A rogue AI encrypted its network logs using an LCG-based cipher. Recover the plaintext and expose its secrets from the ciphertext below: 7db073a960b071fb6bb368f677a1

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1161963944
  - Multiplier: 573517987
  - Increment: 861118455
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1036683685, 932138542, 1033918505, 228643570, 234376077] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{lc5poz8l}
ciphertext: 7db073a960b071fb6bb368f677a1
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
