An old hacker left a message, but the key vanished. Can you recover the original password hidden in this Autokey-ciphered note? The ciphertext: cv cipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{8j76okes}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{8q76btef}
ciphertext: cv cipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{8j76okes}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: uiy
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
