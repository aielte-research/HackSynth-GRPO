Intercepted at midnight, the flag is hidden in a message encrypted using a PRNG seeded with the current time. The ciphertext is: 666c2ae27b6b2ded39633fb1797d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 46976)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-16 13:20:05 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{kfh9ct4y}
ciphertext: 666c2ae27b6b2ded39633fb1797d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 46976)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-16 13:20:05 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 19333.
