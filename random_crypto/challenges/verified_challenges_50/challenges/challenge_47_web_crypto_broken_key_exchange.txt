Agents exchanged secrets using Diffie-Hellman. Someone intercepted their encrypted message. Can you recover the shared key and decrypt this: e34bc9f69946215138995aa35356?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 44 and Bob's public key is 70.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
