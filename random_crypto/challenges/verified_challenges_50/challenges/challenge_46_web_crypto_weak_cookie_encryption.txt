Eager to impress, Alice implemented AES-ECB, but padded her short password with null bytes. Can you recover the flag from this slip? Ciphertext: f6550a9eb5d0a69910cb454c75666c76


An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1cnirjy3}
ciphertext: f6550a9eb5d0a69910cb454c75666c76
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
