A rogue agent hid the next drop location using an Autokey cipher. Can you decipher the message and reach the target first? Ciphertext: lp bgku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{wzbw16j2}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{egof16j2}
ciphertext: lp bgku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{wzbw16j2}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: dcxg
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
