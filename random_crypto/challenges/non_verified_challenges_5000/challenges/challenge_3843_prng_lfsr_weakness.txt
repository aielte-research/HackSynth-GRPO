Intercepted radio chatter reveals a secret code. Can you break the message encrypted with a flawed LFSR scheme? Decipher this: 4a124d19570e431759165b121a03

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[64147, 64841, 32420, 16210, 8105, 36820, 51178, 25589, 45562, 22781]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{poiuhwl6}
ciphertext: 4a124d19570e431759165b121a03
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[64147, 64841, 32420, 16210, 8105, 36820, 51178, 25589, 45562, 22781]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
