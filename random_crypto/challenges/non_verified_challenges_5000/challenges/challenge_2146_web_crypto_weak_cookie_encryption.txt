A careless intern encrypted the company secret with AES-ECB, padding a 3-byte key with nulls. The ciphertext is: e3843779eb719ab96f7a07f3faddf107. Can you recover the plaintext?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{hnsghzy8}
ciphertext: e3843779eb719ab96f7a07f3faddf107
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
