Intercepted radio messages use a homebrew stream cipher, but analysts suspect an LFSR flaw. Can you recover the message? Ciphertext: 512856234c28542f54734f225639

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[4786, 35161, 17580, 41558, 53547, 59541, 29770, 47653, 56594, 28297]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{lckc7xfa}
ciphertext: 512856234c28542f54734f225639
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[4786, 35161, 17580, 41558, 53547, 59541, 29770, 47653, 56594, 28297]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
