A rogue bot encrypted the secret with LCG Predictability, boasting it's "impossible" to guess. Prove it wrong using 5598d1b6489adfb85dcdc6e00689 to recover the original message.


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1866599250
  - Multiplier: 1206238799
  - Increment: 110990470
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [748833905, 1361368565, 1647591155, 1014111065, 287790905] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{noin9v15}
ciphertext: 5598d1b6489adfb85dcdc6e00689
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
