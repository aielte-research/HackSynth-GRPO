Intercepted during a secret exchange, agents’ message encrypted with Diffie-Hellman waits for you to reveal their key—can you decrypt 2520fa3d9e2c1d5f8df6db7644b7?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 67 and Bob's public key is 8.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
