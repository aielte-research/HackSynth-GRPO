The hacker's prize wallet is locked using an LCG Predictability cipher. Can you recover the original secret from this piece: 62a0f0d17ff5a38736b6f7d031b1?


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 285199171
  - Multiplier: 22116659
  - Increment: 254978340
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [237756459, 245271035, 24885737, 275610041, 259001519] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{9212zff5}
ciphertext: 62a0f0d17ff5a38736b6f7d031b1
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
