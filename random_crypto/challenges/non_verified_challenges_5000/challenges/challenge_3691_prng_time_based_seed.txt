An agent encrypted the passcode using a time-synced PRNG cipher. Recover the original message from this ciphertext: 666c55ce7b3545cc39314ddc6c7d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 67418)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:35:07 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{5qe91yul}
ciphertext: 666c55ce7b3545cc39314ddc6c7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 67418)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:35:07 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 13481.
