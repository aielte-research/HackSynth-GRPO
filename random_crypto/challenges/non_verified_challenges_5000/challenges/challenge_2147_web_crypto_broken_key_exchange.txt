Alice and Bob exchanged secret plans using Diffie-Hellman. An attacker intercepted their message: 3533c26a055fb1f27bc63d5f400e. Recover their shared secret to reveal the plans.

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 51 and Bob's public key is 22.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
