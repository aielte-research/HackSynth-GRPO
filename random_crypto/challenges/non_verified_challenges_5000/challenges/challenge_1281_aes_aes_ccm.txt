## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{aeo046rc}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:c7a3fbcb55adeffa6599e08647b5, ciphertext2: c7a3fbcb55aee5fd629bb3cd15b5
tag1: 6b9c1b519c4b42799615e0aa2b18c495
tag2: 4a5f1cc7446ecfc09e884bcc5384026a
cipher: AES
mode: CCM
hint: AES-CCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: eb4dbe44044f64358bc1ec
subtype: aes_ccm
archetype: aes
