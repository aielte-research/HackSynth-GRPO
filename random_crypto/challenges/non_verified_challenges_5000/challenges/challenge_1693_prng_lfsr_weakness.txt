Intercepted transmission from rival hackers uses a flawed LFSR stream cipher. Recover the original message from this 9f91989a829f8a9b818c938a9380 ciphertext.


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[63339, 64437, 64986, 65261, 32630, 16315, 40925, 53230, 59383, 62459]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{bsfxqjwj}
ciphertext: 9f91989a829f8a9b818c938a9380
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[63339, 64437, 64986, 65261, 32630, 16315, 40925, 53230, 59383, 62459]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
