A hacker left a password protected by a PRNG seeded at a secret past moment. Can you reconstruct the timing to unlock the message? Ciphertext: 666c6a5c7b377c5730706f55617d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 26327)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:20:40 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7wl0pdna}
ciphertext: 666c6a5c7b377c5730706f55617d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 26327)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:20:40 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 2875.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
