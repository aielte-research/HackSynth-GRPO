A hacker intercepted a secret blockchain key exchange, but itâ€™s encoded with an Autokey cipher. Crack this to reveal the hidden seed: bl ynku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{6ecu3jqy}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{6mjh3sql}
ciphertext: bl ynku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{6ecu3jqy}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: tyun
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
