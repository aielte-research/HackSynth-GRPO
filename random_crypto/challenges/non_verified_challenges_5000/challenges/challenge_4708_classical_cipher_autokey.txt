A hacker group left clues in a message encrypted with an Autokey cipher. Your mission: recover the secret plans hidden inside. Ciphertext: jb tipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{ijcpckr0}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{pwlpphd0}
ciphertext: jb tipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{ijcpckr0}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: bop
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
