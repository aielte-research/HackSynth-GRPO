Intercepted messages are encrypted using an LCG-based scheme. Can you recover the original flag from this predictable stream? Ciphertext: 54bf9f4949ab8c5c45a3891a5cae

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 869823732
  - Multiplier: 458771530
  - Increment: 711563262
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [707776314, 698586330, 283662174, 331200510, 648399078] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{xrrwpw4n}
ciphertext: 54bf9f4949ab8c5c45a3891a5cae
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
