Our server used timestamps as PRNG seeds to encrypt secrets. Can you recover the flag from this intercepted message? 666c53f17b635cf86e7a5dfe6f7d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 85193)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:39:11 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{cnnnzoho}
ciphertext: 666c53f17b635cf86e7a5dfe6f7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
