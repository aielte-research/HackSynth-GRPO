A hacker claims to have hidden a password in this message, encrypted using the Autokey cipher. They dare you to break it: xn zeku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{k7z0pwuz}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{s7g0cfum}
ciphertext: xn zeku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{k7z0pwuz}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: pave
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
