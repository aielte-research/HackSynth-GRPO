The intern encrypted a flag using AES-ECB, padding a short key with null bytes. Can you recover the flag from fc791d7cb35eef4578d41d3810c16947?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{hylvwu0q}
ciphertext: fc791d7cb35eef4578d41d3810c16947
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
