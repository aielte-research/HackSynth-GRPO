Intercepted comms from a notorious hacker group were encrypted with a flawed LFSR-based cipher. Can you recover their secret by cracking the ciphertext? 4797409c5acb45cf129944981386


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{0d43bec2}
ciphertext: 4797409c5acb45cf129944981386
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[60685, 63110, 64323, 64929, 32464, 16232, 8116, 4058, 34797, 17398]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
