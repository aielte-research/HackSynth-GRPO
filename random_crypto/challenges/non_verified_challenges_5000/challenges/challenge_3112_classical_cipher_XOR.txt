Intercepted spy messages were scrambled using a simple XOR cipher. Can you recover the vital clue encoded here: stringA: 3c14232a4c15413a020f4c1d774e stringB: 5a78424d3770724f3163786a4733?

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{e3u3l4w0}
cipher: XOR
ciphertext: stringA: 3c14232a4c15413a020f4c1d774e stringB: 5a78424d3770724f3163786a4733
hint: XOR is undone by XORing again with the same key. (A XOR B = C â‡’ C XOR B = A)
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: Both strings are in hex. XOR the two provided hex strings to recover the flag.
subtype: XOR
archetype: classical_cipher
