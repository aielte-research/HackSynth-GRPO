An intern re-encrypted two messages for the CEO using AES-GCM but accidentally reused the same nonce. The cipher output was intercepted: ciphertext1:da6489b967cebbbf1dd0ccec5700, ciphertext2: c86081ad3c95b8e543c6dca5435d7bce0592.

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{2pz0ydiu}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:da6489b967cebbbf1dd0ccec5700, ciphertext2: c86081ad3c95b8e543c6dca5435d7bce0592
tag1: 810141092fcddf2a51bbd35ebe018ab6
tag2: b99298caec75dcd66554cbbe9cab8adb
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 771b0077dc2934ebfacf8c75
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
