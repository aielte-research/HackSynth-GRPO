An intercepted spy message uses a flawed LFSR-based cipher. Crack the weakness in f1c6f6cdecc2f3cdfec9a1cdfdd7 to discover the hidden operation details.

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[43035, 21517, 43526, 54531, 60033, 62784, 31392, 48464, 24232, 12116]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{hdgic6gj}
ciphertext: f1c6f6cdecc2f3cdfec9a1cdfdd7
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[43035, 21517, 43526, 54531, 60033, 62784, 31392, 48464, 24232, 12116]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
