Agent X intercepted a message, but suspects it uses the Autokey cipher. Decryption may reveal the next rendezvous point: zz iipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{h562ilaf}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{o562vuas}
ciphertext: zz iipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{h562ilaf}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: rme
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
