Intercepted at midnight, the confidential message encrypted with a time-synchronized PRNG awaits you. Extract the flag from this 666d5bad7b694fad387b4afe727c before the clock strikes again.

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 88625)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:53:58 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
