Intercepted at midnight, the hacker's secret message uses a time-based PRNG cipher. Can you recover the original text from this ciphertext? 666c6aeb7b7969eb6c317ebb6e7d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 38562)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:42:01 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ybgl1u7n}
ciphertext: 666c6aeb7b7969eb6c317ebb6e7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 38562)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:42:01 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 2956.
