An encrypted message was intercepted from a secret network. Rumors say itâ€™s protected with AES. Can you recover its contents? Here is the ciphertext: ciphertext1:e295647fc03deeea8f60287df77d, ciphertext2: e295647fc02de4b4ca69703fe07d

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{zam4dn0t}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:e295647fc03deeea8f60287df77d, ciphertext2: e295647fc02de4b4ca69703fe07d
tag1: 0304bef6a7ced4c72d6d795c52b01c7f
tag2: 52eec0b35af785933bf75536ea774266
cipher: AES
mode: CCM
hint: AES-CCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: bc61c6a30e43ec83c89db4
subtype: aes_ccm
archetype: aes
