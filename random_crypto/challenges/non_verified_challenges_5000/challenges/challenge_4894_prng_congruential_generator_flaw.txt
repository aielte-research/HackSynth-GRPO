An eager developer used a basic LCG to generate the encryption key for this secret message: 735bdd046e5f8d57675fc91b7f4a. Can you predict the next key and decrypt it?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 549382220
  - Multiplier: 155961645
  - Increment: 140022028
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [193975023, 119469743, 393855323, 374001283, 358353763] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{h14rhuxj}
ciphertext: 735bdd046e5f8d57675fc91b7f4a
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
