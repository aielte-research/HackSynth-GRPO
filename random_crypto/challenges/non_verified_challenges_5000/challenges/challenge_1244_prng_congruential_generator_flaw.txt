A hacker left a secret message for their partner, but encrypted it using their hastily coded LCG Predictability cipher. Can you reveal the flag? Ciphertext: 71f43c156cee2c4723ad2f1d74e5


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1596099130
  - Multiplier: 402029093
  - Increment: 1028792785
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1033281029, 583980432, 275063711, 292535028, 636682559] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{vq545roc}
ciphertext: 71f43c156cee2c4723ad2f1d74e5
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
