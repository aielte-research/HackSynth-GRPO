The hacker group "RandomSeed" claims their RNG is unbreakable. Prove them wrong by recovering their secret message: 6893c94075ccca4a3889d0416382

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1775193001
  - Multiplier: 807989665
  - Increment: 1505618087
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1517832973, 1106803416, 410507561, 1158657191, 1228219382] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{3bm6vxfm}
ciphertext: 6893c94075ccca4a3889d0416382
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
