Our intern encrypted the flag with a homebrew cipher, using Python's random module as a keystream. Can you recover the flag from 6037673c7d683322752c72346726?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 2**11)
A secret number was generated using Python's PRNG with a seed from 0 to 9,999. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{35yswtoa}
ciphertext: 6037673c7d683322752c72346726
cipher: Predictable PRNG
hint: The seed range is small enough for brute-force. Try recreating the PRNG sequence.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 2**11)
A secret number was generated using Python's PRNG with a seed from 0 to 9,999. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: If you can predict or brute-force the seed, you can reconstruct the PRNG output and decrypt the flag.
subtype: predictable_seed
archetype: prng
