An informant encoded vital coordinates using the Autokey cipher before capture. Only the encrypted message remains: dh aqku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{fmkkldz2}. Can you recover the original secret?

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ntxtlqw2}
ciphertext: dh aqku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{fmkkldz2}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: vuwq
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
