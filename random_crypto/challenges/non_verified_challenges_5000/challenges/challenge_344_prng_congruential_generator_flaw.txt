A hacker left this message scrambled with a predictable LCG stream. Can you outsmart their weak cipher and recover the hidden flag? 25a9f82338aea12733f5ed252bb8

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1787618494
  - Multiplier: 1604495281
  - Increment: 1526614851
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1165272377, 1673168700, 907543233, 174108150, 737859819] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{k8cp0tah}
ciphertext: 25a9f82338aea12733f5ed252bb8
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
