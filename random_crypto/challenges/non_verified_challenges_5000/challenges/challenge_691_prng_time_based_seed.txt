The museum’s artifact logs are scrambled each midnight for security. Can you recover tonight’s entry encrypted with their shifting time-based cipher? Ciphertext: 666c28807b6139d6767778d76a7d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 63140)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:53:31 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
