A mysterious hacker left a note encrypted with the same key as the message's first few letters. Can you reveal their secret? Here it is: ne pipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{q4rowsce}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{x4exwfzq}
ciphertext: ne pipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{q4rowsce}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: frl
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
