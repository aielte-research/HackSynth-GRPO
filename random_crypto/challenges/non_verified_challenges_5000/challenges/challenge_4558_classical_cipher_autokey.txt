Agent Lynx hid the coordinates with an Autokey cipher. Only the keyword survivesâ€”can you reveal the drop site from this encrypted message? ih nsku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{kohj6k72}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{svus6k72}
ciphertext: ih nsku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{kohj6k72}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: aujs
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
