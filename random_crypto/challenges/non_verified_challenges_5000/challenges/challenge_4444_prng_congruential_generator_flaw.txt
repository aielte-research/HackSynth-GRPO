The hacker's vault uses an LCG-based lock. Can you crack the predictable cipher text? Here it is: 36cdc9cc2b99d89b63c7ced369dc

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1361466986
  - Multiplier: 435774748
  - Increment: 625899303
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1012582475, 1295867641, 1096558133, 292084723, 297494977] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{8p03ffx9}
ciphertext: 36cdc9cc2b99d89b63c7ced369dc
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
