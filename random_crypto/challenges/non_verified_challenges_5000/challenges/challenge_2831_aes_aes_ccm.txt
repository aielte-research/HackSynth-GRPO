Agent Iris intercepted a message from CipherCorp. Itâ€™s encrypted with AES. Can you help her uncover the secret? Encrypted text: ciphertext1:c41f0ff23fb26c1569dd43d95b57, ciphertext2: c41f0ff23fa1704a638351c44457

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{xyoc2tuh}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:c41f0ff23fb26c1569dd43d95b57, ciphertext2: c41f0ff23fa1704a638351c44457
tag1: 258f9b31cf20b096e598cd818ad1117d
tag2: 0037b4181bde386aadff90b612444357
cipher: AES
mode: CCM
hint: AES-CCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: f75f2fd07b60e9002d6e2c
subtype: aes_ccm
archetype: aes
