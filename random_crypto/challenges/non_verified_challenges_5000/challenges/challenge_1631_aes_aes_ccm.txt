A mysterious hacker sent you a file encrypted with AES. They claim ciphertext1:afe5936bafb2e12c5f7e7e6acd2d, ciphertext2: afe5936bafb7a528586e3323d22d hides the key to their next puzzle. Can you decrypt it?

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{q55qv93k}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:afe5936bafb2e12c5f7e7e6acd2d, ciphertext2: afe5936bafb7a528586e3323d22d
tag1: 8e45778648fd292b060a596af007a2e4
tag2: f9fc7d1acbdaceb71c5fd88c8e84bef3
cipher: AES
mode: CCM
hint: AES-CCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 600f8bd43236c037d9cef4
subtype: aes_ccm
archetype: aes
