A rookie hacker encrypted the flag with a basic LCG Predictability cipher. Can you exploit the weak randomness and recover the hidden message? Ciphertext: 3c26ec792130b5733f3bfb6b3637


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1873623408
  - Multiplier: 769358997
  - Increment: 455311526
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1096064096, 1749093926, 323944388, 1763231354, 1015685912] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{z8meqvul}
ciphertext: 3c26ec792130b5733f3bfb6b3637
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
