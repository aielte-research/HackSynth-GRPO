A spy intercepted a message exchanged with Diffie-Hellman. She needs to recover the secret using the partial info below. The encrypted text is: d1c90914b6417e19700951eb0ee9

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 85 and Bob's public key is 45.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{6a54dgpj}
ciphertext: d1c90914b6417e19700951eb0ee9
cipher: Diffie-Hellman
hint: The prime used in this key exchange is small. You can recover the private key by brute-force.
necessary_info: The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 85 and Bob's public key is 45.
