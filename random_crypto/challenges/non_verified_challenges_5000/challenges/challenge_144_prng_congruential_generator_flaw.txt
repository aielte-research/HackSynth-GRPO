The casino's slots RNG broke, so they used an LCG to encrypt jackpot codes. Can you predict and recover the winning code from 6772f29f7a6be788336aea8f3163?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 507918335
  - Multiplier: 161506315
  - Increment: 446867016
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [378184566, 379779691, 358043711, 214415911, 461522791] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{utp2tyw0}
ciphertext: 6772f29f7a6be788336aea8f3163
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
