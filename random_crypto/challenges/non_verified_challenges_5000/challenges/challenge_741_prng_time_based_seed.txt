An old server spits out codes encrypted with system time as a seed. The latest dump looks promisingâ€”can you recover its secret? 666ccfab7b73c0aa366e98f86a7d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 58580)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:54:35 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{snf6n64j}
ciphertext: 666ccfab7b73c0aa366e98f86a7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 58580)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:54:35 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 44748.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
