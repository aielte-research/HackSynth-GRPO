Intercepted from a rogue agentâ€™s radio, this LFSR-encrypted message could expose their plans. Can you decode the secret transmission? Ciphertext: a62aa121bb31a123a92cb623b73b

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{waeijvew}
ciphertext: a62aa121bb31a123a92cb623b73b
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[6678, 36107, 18053, 9026, 4513, 2256, 1128, 564, 282, 32909]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
