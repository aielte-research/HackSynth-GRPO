A hacker encoded the server password using the Autokey cipher. Your mission: decrypt hy lipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{v16d6b15} to recover access before the next security sweep.


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{c16q6k15}
ciphertext: hy lipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{v16d6b15}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: zlh
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
