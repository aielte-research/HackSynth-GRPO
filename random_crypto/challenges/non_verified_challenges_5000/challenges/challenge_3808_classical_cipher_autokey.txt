You've intercepted a spy's Autokey-encrypted message. The keyword is hidden in plain sight. Can you reveal their secret? Ciphertext: kg uiku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{9ohn6ojj}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{9woa6xjw}
ciphertext: kg uiku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{9ohn6ojj}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: ctqi
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
