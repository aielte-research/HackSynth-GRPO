Evan sent a secret code using a quickly-coded PRNG. The intercepted message, encrypted with LCG Predictability, is: 5b1d37fa461e39f04b4637f44b0c


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1695043276
  - Multiplier: 1206275296
  - Increment: 1188946953
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [806015293, 696868893, 1389841409, 714633149, 13164025] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{oomv7aiv}
ciphertext: 5b1d37fa461e39f04b4637f44b0c
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
