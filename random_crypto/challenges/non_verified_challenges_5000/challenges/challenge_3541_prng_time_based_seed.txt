A hacker hid the passcode in 666c6f697b626c3d67327c3e697d, encrypted with a PRNG seeded from the server's timestamp. Can you recover the original message?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 29636)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:31:35 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{bb3g2r0i}
ciphertext: 666c6f697b626c3d67327c3e697d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 29636)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:31:35 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 3598.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
