A lost memo encrypted with ECC's small-order curves conceals a vital password. Crack Public key: (3, 6) to reveal the secret before the window closes.

Curve equation: y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 3 (mod 97)
Generator G = (3, 6), group order ~ 5
Find d such that d*G = PublicKey.The flag format is flag{private_key}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1}
ciphertext: Public key: (3, 6)
cipher: ECC - small_order_curves
hint: A small prime field with small group order means discrete log can be brute-forced easily.
necessary_info: Curve equation: y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 3 (mod 97)
Generator G = (3, 6), group order ~ 5
Find d such that d*G = PublicKey.The flag format is flag{private_key}
extra_info: Private key: d=1
We used p=97, a=2, b=3, G=(3, 6), group order=5
subtype: small_order_curves
archetype: ecc
