A hacker intercepted a secret transmission from a rogue AI. The message is encrypted with an LFSR-based cipher. Can you break it and reveal the secret? 1155165e0c534450155b01540544

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{j3ibbvmr}
ciphertext: 1155165e0c534450155b01540544
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[59366, 29683, 14841, 40188, 52862, 59199, 29599, 47567, 56551, 61043]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
