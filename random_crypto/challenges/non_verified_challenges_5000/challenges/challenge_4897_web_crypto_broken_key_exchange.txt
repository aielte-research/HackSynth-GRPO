Intercepted during a secret exchange, Alice and Bob's shared key secures this message with Diffie-Hellman. Can you uncover their secret to decrypt 27a3a1b689b815d42266d61d14f9?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 80 and Bob's public key is 67.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
