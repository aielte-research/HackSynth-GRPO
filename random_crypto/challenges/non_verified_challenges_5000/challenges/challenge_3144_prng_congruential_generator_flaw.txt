Intercepted messages from a rogue developer were encrypted using an insecure LCG-based cipher. Can you recover the original content from this predictable stream? Ciphertext: 7893dbf9659ecefb2986d2f96e82

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 2122680297
  - Multiplier: 223396674
  - Increment: 992511809
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [808133423, 1846126718, 466096001, 150247034, 1756751549] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ate7yhgp}
ciphertext: 7893dbf9659ecefb2986d2f96e82
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
