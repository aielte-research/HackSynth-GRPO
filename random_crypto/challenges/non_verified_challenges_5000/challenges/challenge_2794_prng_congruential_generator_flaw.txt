We've intercepted a message from the hacker, encrypted with their homebrew PRNG. Can you break the 7f372e33623e7a32686b25277d26 and reveal their next move?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 634523767
  - Multiplier: 500839059
  - Increment: 550552280
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [149886885, 255822078, 563605890, 253925649, 149608772] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{e5fq0jsd}
ciphertext: 7f372e33623e7a32686b25277d26
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
