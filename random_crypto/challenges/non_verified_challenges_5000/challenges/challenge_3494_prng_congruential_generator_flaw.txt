Intercepted casino messages were encrypted using a predictable random number generator. Can you break their LCG-based cipher and reveal the original content? 55c26e0848de7d585cde3b0c06d3

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1544735132
  - Multiplier: 257710527
  - Increment: 1159129090
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [163483271, 212758127, 1238983171, 3977487, 1538493499] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{pr7op4c5}
ciphertext: 55c26e0848de7d585cde3b0c06d3
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
