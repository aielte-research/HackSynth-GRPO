Eve found Alice's encrypted note. Suspecting a weak key padded with null bytes in AES-ECB, she examines the ciphertext: 0fac73ef69214f6a5ab3862ae270865c


An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{4u8gjgbv}
ciphertext: 0fac73ef69214f6a5ab3862ae270865c
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
