The clock controlling our vaultâ€™s cipher has glitched. If you know how time seeds its PRNG, you can recover the plaintext from this encoded message: 666c7e797b6b6b7a3778776c6f7d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 86872)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:56:49 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ktd7xhro}
ciphertext: 666c7e797b6b6b7a3778776c6f7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 86872)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:56:49 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 7966.
