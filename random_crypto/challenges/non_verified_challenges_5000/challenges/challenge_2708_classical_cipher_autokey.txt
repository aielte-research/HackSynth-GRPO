Agent Zero intercepted a message from a rival, encrypted with an old Autokey cipher. Crack the code to reveal their secret plan: ju aipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{w9o6fsjl}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{d9b6oswi}
ciphertext: ju aipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{w9o6fsjl}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: bhw
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
