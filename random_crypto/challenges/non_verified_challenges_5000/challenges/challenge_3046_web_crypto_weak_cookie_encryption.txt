A careless dev used AES-ECB with a short secret key, padded by null bytes. Can you recover the original key used to encrypt 4d21d1a05251ff11f6760e8ab958ee83?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{3oayaoix}
ciphertext: 4d21d1a05251ff11f6760e8ab958ee83
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
