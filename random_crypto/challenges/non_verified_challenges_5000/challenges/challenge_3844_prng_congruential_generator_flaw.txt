Eve intercepted Bobâ€™s message to Alice, encrypted with a basic LCG-based scheme. Can you predict the key stream and recover the flag from 7b8985b066d594ba68d687a57098?


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1006255762
  - Multiplier: 873310118
  - Increment: 658700655
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [149499657, 828232239, 78279437, 911603771, 127308779] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{0pmu3crm}
ciphertext: 7b8985b066d594ba68d687a57098
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
