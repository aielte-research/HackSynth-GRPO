Intercepted secret communications contain 9d074220c565466c9c8833c9860aeaf7, encrypted using AES-ECB. Rumor has it they padded a very short key with null bytes. Can you recover the original message?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{gqq6tevx}
ciphertext: 9d074220c565466c9c8833c9860aeaf7
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
