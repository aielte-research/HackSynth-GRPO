A secret agent intercepted an encoded message between spies using Diffie-Hellman. Can you derive their shared key and decrypt the hidden message? Ciphertext: e77be7ca61d721eaed53eb3042d6

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 50 and Bob's public key is 9.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{0k50s630}
ciphertext: e77be7ca61d721eaed53eb3042d6
cipher: Diffie-Hellman
hint: The prime used in this key exchange is small. You can recover the private key by brute-force.
