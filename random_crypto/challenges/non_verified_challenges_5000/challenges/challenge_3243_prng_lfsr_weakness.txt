A hacker used a flawed stream cipher to send a secret plan. Only the 1f06180d021b1059411d11031e17 message remains, and it's up to you to uncover the weakness and recover the plaintext.

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[43800, 54668, 27334, 46435, 23217, 11608, 38572, 52054, 58795, 62165]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qi38whig}
ciphertext: 1f06180d021b1059411d11031e17
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[43800, 54668, 27334, 46435, 23217, 11608, 38572, 52054, 58795, 62165]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
