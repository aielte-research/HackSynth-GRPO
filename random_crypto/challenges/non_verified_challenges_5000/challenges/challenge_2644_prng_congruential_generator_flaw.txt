Intercepted messages from a rogue agent use a suspiciously predictable cipher. Can you recover the secret text from this LCG-based encrypted communication? Ciphertext: 54604a0749384a075d605c084271

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1449929853
  - Multiplier: 328226832
  - Increment: 357546354
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [584983005, 36657537, 1348442619, 489090966, 546225765] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{4agolwhp}
ciphertext: 54604a0749384a075d605c084271
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
