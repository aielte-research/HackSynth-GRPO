Intercepted transmissions from a rogue satellite use a flawed stream cipher. Can you recover the secret message from the output below? Ciphertext: 3244354f2f523f1f60453d493755

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[41033, 20516, 10258, 5129, 2564, 34050, 17025, 41280, 20640, 43088]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{zk74miac}
ciphertext: 3244354f2f523f1f60453d493755
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[41033, 20516, 10258, 5129, 2564, 34050, 17025, 41280, 20640, 43088]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
