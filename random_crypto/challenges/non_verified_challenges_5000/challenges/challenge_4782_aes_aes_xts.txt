A secret vault at CypherCorp was locked with AES-XTS. Only those who decrypt ciphertext1:32160b3e55f7f9f30193de5b9a256de9, ciphertext2: c199148e8ce9baec1bc888664c89a0b46dbaf2fed2de2d25eb19673b129dfb0c can access the CEOâ€™s final message. Can you reveal it?


The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{xavckcf1}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:32160b3e55f7f9f30193de5b9a256de9, ciphertext2: c199148e8ce9baec1bc888664c89a0b46dbaf2fed2de2d25eb19673b129dfb0c
cipher: AES-XTS
hint: AES-XTS with tweak reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The tweak used for both encryptions is: 77350642b17c38a4da743a5983222488
subtype: aes_xts
archetype: aes
