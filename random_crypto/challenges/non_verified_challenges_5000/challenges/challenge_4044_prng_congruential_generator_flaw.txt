The hacker's login tokens are generated with predictable random numbers. Recover the original token used from this intercepted ciphertext: 4b89427d56d047711d80162c4698

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1091180693
  - Multiplier: 213704028
  - Increment: 117851114
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [89918113, 828192170, 229668214, 871418672, 686304511] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{5dk0e56k}
ciphertext: 4b89427d56d047711d80162c4698
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
