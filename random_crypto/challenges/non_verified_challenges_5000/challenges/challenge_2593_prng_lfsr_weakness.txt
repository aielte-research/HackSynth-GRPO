An intercepted spy message was encrypted using a stream cipher with a weak LFSR. Can you recover the original message from the ciphertext? e861ef6af57dbd63eb3ff93deb70

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[13340, 6670, 3335, 1667, 33601, 49568, 57552, 28776, 14388, 7194]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{p3ne2w0e}
ciphertext: e861ef6af57dbd63eb3ff93deb70
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[13340, 6670, 3335, 1667, 33601, 49568, 57552, 28776, 14388, 7194]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
