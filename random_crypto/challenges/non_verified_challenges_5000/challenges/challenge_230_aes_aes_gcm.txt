Two messages were sent using AES-GCM, but the same nonce was accidentally reused. Hereâ€™s the resulting ciphertext: ciphertext1:d704b6c043aaa4cc6e073b8144b3, ciphertext2: c500bed418f6bfde6f013ac416eeeb87a0e9. Can you uncover the plaintexts?

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{5h2oiue3}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:d704b6c043aaa4cc6e073b8144b3, ciphertext2: c500bed418f6bfde6f013ac416eeeb87a0e9
tag1: cb9b4869ea5ee7dbda664bfd7cee9b23
tag2: 8794dbb53f42a8356e699eec1f8e6991
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 0e155f6735b14da01b7b3c19
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
