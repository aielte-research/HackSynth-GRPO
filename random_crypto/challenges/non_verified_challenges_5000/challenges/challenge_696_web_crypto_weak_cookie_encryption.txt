A hasty intern secured launch codes by encrypting them with AES-ECB, padding a small key with null bytes. Can you recover the original message from 4c413d59f3a68986eba88764484ee905?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{z9e41cse}
ciphertext: 4c413d59f3a68986eba88764484ee905
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
