Two secret files were encrypted with AES-GCM, but the developer accidentally reused the nonce. Can you recover the original messages from the ciphertexts below? ciphertext1:80d4cdac15f3f3561ad694e05455, ciphertext2: 92d0c5b84eece61147d78aa90708d8ecdd70

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{vfg3nji2}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:80d4cdac15f3f3561ad694e05455, ciphertext2: 92d0c5b84eece61147d78aa90708d8ecdd70
tag1: 5f4db7b26b939dd4438b0ad3b787ecd8
tag2: 77be6a7e10aa72de1e98074cf4200d41
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 4ce5fc303d0821edc3af832f
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
