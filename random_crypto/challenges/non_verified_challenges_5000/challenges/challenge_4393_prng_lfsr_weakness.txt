An old hacker left a note encrypted with a stream cipher known to have an LFSR weakness. Can you recover the secret from this 838884839e919192818d878f8a99?

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[37227, 51381, 58458, 61997, 30998, 48267, 24133, 12066, 38801, 52168]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{utvdibko}
ciphertext: 838884839e919192818d878f8a99
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[37227, 51381, 58458, 61997, 30998, 48267, 24133, 12066, 38801, 52168]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
