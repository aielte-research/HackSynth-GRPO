Intercepted at midnight, this message conceals the vault code. Its creator relied on a time-based PRNG for encryption. Can you reveal its secrets? 666d750e7b67205a37776604307c

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 77298)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:39:53 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
