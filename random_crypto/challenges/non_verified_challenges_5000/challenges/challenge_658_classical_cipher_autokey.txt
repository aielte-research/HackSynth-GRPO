A notorious hacker left a secret meeting location encrypted with an Autokey cipher. Can you reveal where to meet by deciphering: xc egku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{lrfyzxw7}?

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{tyshzkt7}
ciphertext: xc egku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{lrfyzxw7}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: ppag
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
