An encrypted message, generated by a time-based PRNG, was intercepted during a hacker's live stream. Can you recover the flag from the mysterious 666c76867b362e9367322290687d?


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 66266)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:51:23 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{69rg25qh}
ciphertext: 666c76867b362e9367322290687d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 66266)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:51:23 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 6113.
