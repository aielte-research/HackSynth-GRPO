Intercepted from a hacker forum, this message hides critical wallet info. Can you break the Autokey cipher? Ciphertext: ep jaku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{gt65teos}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{oa65gnof}
ciphertext: ep jaku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{gt65teos}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
