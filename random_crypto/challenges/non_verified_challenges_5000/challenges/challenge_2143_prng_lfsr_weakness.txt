Intercepted radio traffic uses a homemade LFSR-based stream cipher. We need the plaintext hidden in b5fcb2f7a8a8a5e1bff7b8a4a3edâ€”can you break their weak encryption?


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[16680, 8340, 36938, 51237, 58386, 29193, 14596, 40066, 20033, 42784]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{8vqlgk4p}
ciphertext: b5fcb2f7a8a8a5e1bff7b8a4a3ed
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[16680, 8340, 36938, 51237, 58386, 29193, 14596, 40066, 20033, 42784]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
