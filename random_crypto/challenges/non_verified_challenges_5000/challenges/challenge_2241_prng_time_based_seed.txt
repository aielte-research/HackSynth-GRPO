A hacker encrypted a secret using a PRNG seeded with the exact timestamp. Recover the original message from the ciphertext: 666c25547b333e0477382a43707d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 40819)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:00:55 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{3z7w8npp}
ciphertext: 666c25547b333e0477382a43707d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 40819)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:00:55 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 17459.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
