Intercepted 07cea168fc0018cec732b61ffc700f3e from a careless admin. We know they used AES-ECB, padding a tiny passkey with null bytes. Can you recover the original message?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{opima7xk}
ciphertext: 07cea168fc0018cec732b61ffc700f3e
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
