A hacker hid secret coordinates inside 666c4afb7b6645e47a6259fb637d, encrypted using a PRNG seeded with a timestamp. Can you recover the message and find where the treasure is buried?


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 14530)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:26:53 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
