Intercepted at midnight, this message hides its secret behind a ticking clock and a hasty PRNG. Can you reverse time to reveal its contents? 666ca16e7b34f67d3038f230647d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 76684)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:40:19 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
