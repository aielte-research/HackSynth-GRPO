The hacker intercepted a message encrypted with an old LCG-based scheme. Can you predict the sequence and recover the flag from this ciphertext: 615661727c5f6962300b6e7b6447?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 142203380
  - Multiplier: 38132873
  - Increment: 78841197
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [94915288, 136179741, 120112890, 88557307, 460768] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{eiw71nnc}
ciphertext: 615661727c5f6962300b6e7b6447
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
