We've hidden the flag using AES-ECB with a "secure" passphraseâ€”short but padded with null bytes. Can you recover the message? Ciphertext: 5f05337caa97be98127e386250e0bcd7

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{8icyw7ac}
ciphertext: 5f05337caa97be98127e386250e0bcd7
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
