An intern built our prize vault's encryption with a simple number generator. Can you predict the sequence and recover the message? Ciphertext: 27d662b63a8e64bd32ce68a228c7


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1537540203
  - Multiplier: 1475037415
  - Increment: 1377559808
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [226344855, 1055643608, 1504906906, 264115698, 341845208] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{4glstksi}
ciphertext: 27d662b63a8e64bd32ce68a228c7
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
