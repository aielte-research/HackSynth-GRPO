A mysterious note, encrypted with a flawed stream cipher, was intercepted. Break the LFSR Weakness scheme to reveal its secrets. Ciphertext: 52c255c94f9f50d44dc14ede51d3


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[47125, 23562, 44549, 22274, 11137, 38336, 19168, 42352, 53944, 26972]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1dzyozpe}
ciphertext: 52c255c94f9f50d44dc14ede51d3
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[47125, 23562, 44549, 22274, 11137, 38336, 19168, 42352, 53944, 26972]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
