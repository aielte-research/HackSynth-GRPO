Agent Zero left a message encoded with a PRNG cipher seeded at 13:37 UTC. Recover the original text from this ciphertext: 666ccbc27b37cfce6e369b96327d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 68131)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 13:03:55 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7ekn6132}
ciphertext: 666ccbc27b37cfce6e369b96327d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 68131)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 13:03:55 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 43685.
