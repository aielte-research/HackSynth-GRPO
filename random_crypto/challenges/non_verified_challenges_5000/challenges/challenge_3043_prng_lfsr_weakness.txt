An intercepted spy message encrypted with a flawed LFSR-based stream cipher awaits decryption. Can you recover the plaintext from 8ce08beb91b599e692fadae39ff1?


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[12326, 6163, 35849, 17924, 41730, 20865, 43200, 21600, 43568, 54552]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{9sjxv0ou}
ciphertext: 8ce08beb91b599e692fadae39ff1
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[12326, 6163, 35849, 17924, 41730, 20865, 43200, 21600, 43568, 54552]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
