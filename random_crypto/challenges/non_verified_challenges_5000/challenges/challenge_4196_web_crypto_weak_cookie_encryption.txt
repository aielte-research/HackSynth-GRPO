Decrypt the intercepted 16f08abbb1ca8225eafc4443fbc44dea; the intern uploaded it with AES-ECB and a too-short key padded using null bytes. What secret message was sent?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{k94a97rv}
ciphertext: 16f08abbb1ca8225eafc4443fbc44dea
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
