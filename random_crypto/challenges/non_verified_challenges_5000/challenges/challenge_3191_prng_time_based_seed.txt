A hacker scheduled a secret transfer, encrypting the passphrase with a time-based PRNG scheme. Retrieve it from this ciphertext: 666c49ed7b3850be6e704de36d7d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 51596)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:23:24 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{8x4npeim}
ciphertext: 666c49ed7b3850be6e704de36d7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 51596)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:23:24 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 10378.
