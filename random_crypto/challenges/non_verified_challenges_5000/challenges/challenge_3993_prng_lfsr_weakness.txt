Intercepted undersea communication used a homemade stream cipher. Analysts suspect an LFSR weakness. Can you recover the secret message? Ciphertext: 8dfa8af190a1dea59dec9aa6deeb

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[22653, 11326, 38431, 51983, 58759, 29379, 47457, 23728, 44632, 55084]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{753vzq05}
ciphertext: 8dfa8af190a1dea59dec9aa6deeb
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[22653, 11326, 38431, 51983, 58759, 29379, 47457, 23728, 44632, 55084]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
