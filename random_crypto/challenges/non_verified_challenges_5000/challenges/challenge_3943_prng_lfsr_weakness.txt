Intercepted radio chatter was encrypted by an old engineer using a flawed LFSR cipher. Find the original message from this ciphertext: 6f226829723a6a2a64376f376033

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[14536, 40036, 20018, 42777, 21388, 10694, 38115, 19057, 9528, 4764]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{tcdmyfyi}
ciphertext: 6f226829723a6a2a64376f376033
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[14536, 40036, 20018, 42777, 21388, 10694, 38115, 19057, 9528, 4764]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
