An intercepted spy message encrypted with a homemade LFSR stream cipher awaits your cryptanalysis. Can you exploit its weakness to recover the secret? Cipher: 89538e58940f820d9649dd588842

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{0m2yv2gg}
ciphertext: 89538e58940f820d9649dd588842
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[64762, 32381, 16190, 40863, 53199, 59367, 62451, 31225, 48380, 56958]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
