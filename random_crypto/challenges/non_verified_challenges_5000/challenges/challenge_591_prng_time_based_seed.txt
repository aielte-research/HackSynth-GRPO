A hacker sent a message encrypted with a time-seeded PRNG cipher. Can you recover the original text from the intercepted ciphertext below? 666c770b7b65650769702418307d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 18663)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:51:21 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{eskip2t0}
ciphertext: 666c770b7b65650769702418307d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 18663)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:51:21 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 5740.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
