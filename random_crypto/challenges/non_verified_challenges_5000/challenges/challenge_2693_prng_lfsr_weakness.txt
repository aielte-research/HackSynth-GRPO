Intercepted signal uses an LFSR-based stream cipher. Can you break the weak key and recover the plaintext from this ciphertext? f24bf540ef49e54fe640f91ffa5a

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{nqhrgm8n}
ciphertext: f24bf540ef49e54fe640f91ffa5a
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[40652, 20326, 10163, 5081, 2540, 34038, 17019, 41277, 20638, 10319]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
