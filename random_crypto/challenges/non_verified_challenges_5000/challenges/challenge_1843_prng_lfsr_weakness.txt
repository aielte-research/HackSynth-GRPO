Intercepted radio chatter from a rival hacker contains a clue to the vault code, but they've used a weak LFSR stream cipher. The ciphertext: 4cbe4bb551e11cbc4fbf42a645af

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[18878, 42207, 53871, 26935, 46235, 23117, 44326, 22163, 43849, 21924]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{36nemhto}
ciphertext: 4cbe4bb551e11cbc4fbf42a645af
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[18878, 42207, 53871, 26935, 46235, 23117, 44326, 22163, 43849, 21924]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
