Intercepted in a hacker forum, a file labeled “Autokey_vault.txt” contains a cryptic note. Can you decrypt its secret? Ciphertext: qr ulku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{koswsh1s}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{svffsu1p}
ciphertext: qr ulku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{koswsh1s}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: ieql
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
