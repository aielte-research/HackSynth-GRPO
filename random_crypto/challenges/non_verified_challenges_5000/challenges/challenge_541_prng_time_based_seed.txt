Intercepted at midnight, this message uses a timestamped PRNG for encryption. Can you recover the plaintext from the mysterious 666ca1f37b36a9a5696dbaf7327d?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 73676)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:50:18 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{6i1imzc2}
ciphertext: 666ca1f37b36a9a5696dbaf7327d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 73676)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:50:18 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 49300.
