Decrypt the secret message. The server uses AES-ECB and left-pads short keys with null bytes. Ciphertext: f5542e18dd8061c4159ea5b618aafcfc

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{38bvnmiq}
ciphertext: f5542e18dd8061c4159ea5b618aafcfc
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
