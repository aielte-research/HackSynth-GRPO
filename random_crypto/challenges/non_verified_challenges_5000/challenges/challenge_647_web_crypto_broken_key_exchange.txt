A secret key exchange went awry between two agents. An intercepted message, 10c969e0a388a4914a24662ae7ed, holds the clues. Can you recover the shared secret?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 17 and Bob's public key is 21.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{yfxz33hn}
ciphertext: 10c969e0a388a4914a24662ae7ed
cipher: Diffie-Hellman
hint: The prime used in this key exchange is small. You can recover the private key by brute-force.
