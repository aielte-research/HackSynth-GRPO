An agent encoded the secret at midnight using a time-seeded PRNG cipher. Your mission: recover the message from this ciphertext: 666cfbee7b78aefe3134aee26d7d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 52109)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:06:42 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{x4w144km}
ciphertext: 666cfbee7b78aefe3134aee26d7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 52109)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:06:42 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 39561.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
