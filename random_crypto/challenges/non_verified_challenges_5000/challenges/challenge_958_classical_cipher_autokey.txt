An intercepted message marked "Autokey" could reveal the rogue trader's next move. Decrypt it: mx oipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{qqt930ay}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
