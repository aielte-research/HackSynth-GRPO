After a server breach, the key logs were erased, but a single message remained: 666c67647b707f3b79386234377d. Can you recover the secret, knowing the cipher relied on synchronized clocks?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 92796)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:44:35 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{py8y8d77}
ciphertext: 666c67647b707f3b79386234377d
