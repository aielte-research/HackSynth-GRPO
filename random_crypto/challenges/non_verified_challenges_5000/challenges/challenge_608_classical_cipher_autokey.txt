A hacker left a secret in the server logs, encrypted with the Autokey cipher. Can you decrypt this message and uncover the clue? Ciphertext: ps irku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{ze0x8srr}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{hl0k8bre}
ciphertext: ps irku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{ze0x8srr}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: hfer
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
