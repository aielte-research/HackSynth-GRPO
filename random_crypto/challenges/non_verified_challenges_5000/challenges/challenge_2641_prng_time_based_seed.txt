Intercepted at midnight, this secret uses a time-ticking cipher. Only the original timestamp can reverse 666c403e7b6c116d3434182c747d. Can you recover the hidden message?


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 73640)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:10:11 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{l04449ut}
ciphertext: 666c403e7b6c116d3434182c747d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 73640)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:10:11 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 8537.
