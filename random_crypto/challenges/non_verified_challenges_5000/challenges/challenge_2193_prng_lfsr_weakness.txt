Intercepted during a heist, this message was scrambled using a flawed LFSR-based stream cipher. Can you break the weakness and reveal the plan? beb7b9bca3e9b6b2ababa2a1e8a6

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{2nispzz0}
ciphertext: beb7b9bca3e9b6b2ababa2a1e8a6
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[28234, 46885, 56210, 28105, 14052, 7026, 36281, 50908, 25454, 45495]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
