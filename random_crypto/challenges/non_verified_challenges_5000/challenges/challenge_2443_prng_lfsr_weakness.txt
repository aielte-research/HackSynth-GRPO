Intercepted from a rogue satellite, this message was encrypted with a flawed LFSR stream. Can you recover the secret payload? Ciphertext: 933f94348e24c16a913187319e2e

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[20402, 42969, 21484, 43510, 21755, 43645, 21822, 43679, 54607, 60071]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{w49dbrbk}
ciphertext: 933f94348e24c16a913187319e2e
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[20402, 42969, 21484, 43510, 21755, 43645, 21822, 43679, 54607, 60071]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
