Intercepted radio messages encrypted with an outdated LFSR-based scheme. Only f06ff764ed75e47bf87ba664fc7e remains. Can you recover the message and reveal the plan?

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[3214, 1607, 803, 401, 32968, 49252, 24626, 45081, 22540, 11270]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{vrxnx0gj}
ciphertext: f06ff764ed75e47bf87ba664fc7e
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[3214, 1607, 803, 401, 32968, 49252, 24626, 45081, 22540, 11270]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
