A hacker encrypted critical coordinates using a flawed stream cipher. Intercept the ciphertext, break the weak LCG Predictability algorithm, and recover the secret: 6b90608776c93590779e798b6681


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 662482089
  - Multiplier: 94292092
  - Increment: 532621820
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [541233042, 625274603, 161583130, 378624405, 127073903] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{54pzbxkk}
ciphertext: 6b90608776c93590779e798b6681
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
