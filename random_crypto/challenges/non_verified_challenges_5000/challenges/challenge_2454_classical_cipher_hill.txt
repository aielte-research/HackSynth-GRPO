A rogue agent left a secret message encoded with a matrix cipher. Only by decoding agadastdzxepnnggfvfsvnsvwbwdbkfvsunexdneigauddkraocgrpyihhejlbeibjivtw with the right key can you learn the rendezvous coordinates.

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: welcome to the ancient library. hidden within these words is your key:
