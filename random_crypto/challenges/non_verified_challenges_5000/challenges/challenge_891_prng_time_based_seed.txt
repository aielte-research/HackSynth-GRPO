The heist code changes every minute! Recover the original message from the intercepted 666c44007b7116546377565f707d before the clock runs out.


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 13010)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:57:54 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{q33cws8p}
ciphertext: 666c44007b7116546377565f707d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 13010)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:57:54 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 9575.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
