A rogue developer hid the vault access code using an LCG-based cipher. Intercept the ciphertext, 65c3910a7897c40579db9c1b36d2, and exploit the predictability to recover the original code.


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1907529606
  - Multiplier: 503074759
  - Increment: 1871648785
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [262801326, 1760692423, 1144489220, 1045313997, 478037644] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{84hztlv5}
ciphertext: 65c3910a7897c40579db9c1b36d2
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
