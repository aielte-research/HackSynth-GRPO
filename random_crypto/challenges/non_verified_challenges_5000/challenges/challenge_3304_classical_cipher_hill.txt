A secret meeting location is hidden in the ciphertext below. The spies used the Hill cipher to encrypt it. Can you recover the message from mwtykowjaltgancumttvetzgnsribtmtkyvtyzvtqcoeoxnuciaegtceythkigufhgihwz?

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: welcome to the ancient library. hidden within these words is your key:
