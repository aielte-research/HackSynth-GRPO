Intercepting two wizardsâ€™ secret handshake, you captured their exchange: a459010e92bb82a4984c40e03ab2. Can you discover their shared magic number?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 31 and Bob's public key is 66.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
