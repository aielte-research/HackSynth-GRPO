Decrypt the secret message encrypted with AES-ECB; the key is a small passphrase right-padded with null bytes. Ciphertext: 8e8331350bf89caeb8ebca9c544a272c

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{w9bu3qtn}
ciphertext: 8e8331350bf89caeb8ebca9c544a272c
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
