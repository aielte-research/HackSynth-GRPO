Intercepted during a midnight transmission, this LFSR-encrypted message may reveal the safehouse location. Only with keen eyes will 39cc3ec724922dc566913bd732dd surrender its secret.

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[33040, 16520, 41028, 53282, 59409, 62472, 64004, 64770, 32385, 48960]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{2re91dwm}
ciphertext: 39cc3ec724922dc566913bd732dd
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[33040, 16520, 41028, 53282, 59409, 62472, 64004, 64770, 32385, 48960]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
