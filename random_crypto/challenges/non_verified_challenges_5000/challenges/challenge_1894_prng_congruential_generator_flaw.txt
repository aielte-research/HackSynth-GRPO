A hacker left an encrypted message using a predictable LCG-based cipher. Find the pattern, predict the sequence, and decrypt: 6348bfa27e49e9b46b15a8b46159


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 634205456
  - Multiplier: 362403099
  - Increment: 326639429
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [54802488, 207057805, 75731684, 177785969, 351730848] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{m7qn1vqd}
ciphertext: 6348bfa27e49e9b46b15a8b46159
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
