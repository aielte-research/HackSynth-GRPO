Someoneâ€™s locked the server with a pseudorandom code. All you have is this 7e10332663183e226b0821292c01 and rumors they used a Linear Congruential Generator. Can you crack it?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 758682473
  - Multiplier: 554813111
  - Increment: 648453818
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [642583088, 219255157, 739765934, 503542202, 153883933] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{dlcstsh4}
ciphertext: 7e10332663183e226b0821292c01
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
