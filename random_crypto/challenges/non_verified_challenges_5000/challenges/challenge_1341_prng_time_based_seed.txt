The hacker left a secret message, encrypted with a PRNG seeded by their system clock. Can you recover the original text from the cipher below? 666c76877b692ed46c627191647d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 19018)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:38:41 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{i94lbfqd}
ciphertext: 666c76877b692ed46c627191647d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 19018)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:38:41 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 6112.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
