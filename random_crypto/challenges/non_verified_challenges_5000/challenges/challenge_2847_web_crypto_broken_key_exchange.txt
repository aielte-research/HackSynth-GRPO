Alice and Bob exchanged secret messages using Diffie-Hellman. Eve intercepted this ciphertext: 2d4e1610afec76a76c03bf3c3f19. Can you recover their shared secret and reveal the message?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 74 and Bob's public key is 23.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
