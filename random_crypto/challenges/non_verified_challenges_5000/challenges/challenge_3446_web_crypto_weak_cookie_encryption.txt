The admin encrypts secret flags using AES-ECB with user-supplied keys, padding them with null bytes if they're too short. Can you recover the flag from 3f89567a512db541e823a41d3fa5e45c?


An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{c92cel93}
ciphertext: 3f89567a512db541e823a41d3fa5e45c
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
