Agents exchanged secrets over an insecure channel using Diffie-Hellman. An eavesdropper intercepted this message: 8d72528fd37102111bf263cfd2b0. Can you recover the shared key?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 45 and Bob's public key is 68.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
