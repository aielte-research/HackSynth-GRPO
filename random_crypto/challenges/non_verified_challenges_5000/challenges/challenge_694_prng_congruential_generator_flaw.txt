My bot's API keys are encrypted using its own flawed RNG. Can you recover the secrets from this 33ee21342ef72d2462b62a212fff ciphertext?


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 2056577415
  - Multiplier: 1106115810
  - Increment: 1378845632
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [703121597, 1230452942, 640333532, 61639922, 1108528622] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{umw74jrz}
ciphertext: 33ee21342ef72d2462b62a212fff
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
