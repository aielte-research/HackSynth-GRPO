Decrypt my login stored as 4acd74d9e639416b423c48299dbe89c6; I foolishly used AES-ECB with a 3-byte key padded with null bytes.


An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7dkfvew9}
ciphertext: 4acd74d9e639416b423c48299dbe89c6
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
