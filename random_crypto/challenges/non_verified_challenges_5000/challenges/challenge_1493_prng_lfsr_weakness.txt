A secret radio broadcast was intercepted, but its content is hidden by a flawed LFSR-based cipher. Can you recover the original message? Ciphertext: 8c038b08910b8c56dd5f9c06dc12

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[48669, 57102, 28551, 14275, 39905, 19952, 42744, 21372, 43454, 54495]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{df970vi6}
ciphertext: 8c038b08910b8c56dd5f9c06dc12
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[48669, 57102, 28551, 14275, 39905, 19952, 42744, 21372, 43454, 54495]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
