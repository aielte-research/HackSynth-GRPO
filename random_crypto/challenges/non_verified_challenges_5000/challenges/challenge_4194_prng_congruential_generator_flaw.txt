The hacker's wallet password was encrypted using a predictable LCG-based cipher. Can you recover the original password from this ciphertext: 2b7bf754367cfc497b73ef597c6a?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1340715983
  - Multiplier: 930096325
  - Increment: 717362673
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [915253184, 565744078, 731182120, 533215423, 149672899] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{kjz6dyj1}
ciphertext: 2b7bf754367cfc497b73ef597c6a
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
