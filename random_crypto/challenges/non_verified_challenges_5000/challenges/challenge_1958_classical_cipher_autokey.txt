Intercepted by cyber agents, a secret wallet seed was encrypted with an Autokey cipher. Your task: decrypt io iipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{qttxxsfc} to uncover the hidden key.


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{xgcxkprq}
ciphertext: io iipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{qttxxsfc}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: abe
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
