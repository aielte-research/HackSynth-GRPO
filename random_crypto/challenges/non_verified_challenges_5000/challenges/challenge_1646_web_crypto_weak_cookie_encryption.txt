An intern encrypted the flag with AES-ECB, using a tiny password padded with nulls. Can you recover it from 2f8e08584a804bd222b73d1cc4add768?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{5mpxi9cc}
ciphertext: 2f8e08584a804bd222b73d1cc4add768
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
