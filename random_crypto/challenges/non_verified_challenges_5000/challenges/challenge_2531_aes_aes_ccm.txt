An encrypted vault has surfaced. Legend says the passphrase unlocks a hidden key. Can you decrypt ciphertext1:a79009feabcebce1a7ac2960fcd3, ciphertext2: a79009feabd6b1beb3ec7d6cebd3 using the AES cipher and reveal whatâ€™s inside?

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{mjlbu8as}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:a79009feabcebce1a7ac2960fcd3, ciphertext2: a79009feabd6b1beb3ec7d6cebd3
tag1: a56cc42af9f9c1635162197092cd18c2
tag2: 31c847bd36ecbbda1bba2d8bed5b58f9
cipher: AES
mode: CCM
hint: AES-CCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 8dcfeba7edcd9da60f4c87
subtype: aes_ccm
archetype: aes
