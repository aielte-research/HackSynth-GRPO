At midnight, a message was scrambled using a cipher tied to the system clock. Can you recover the flag from this time-locked ciphertext? 666c6a857b34738565646880657d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 23484)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 13:02:36 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{4xgedcbe}
ciphertext: 666c6a857b34738565646880657d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 23484)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 13:02:36 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 3042.
