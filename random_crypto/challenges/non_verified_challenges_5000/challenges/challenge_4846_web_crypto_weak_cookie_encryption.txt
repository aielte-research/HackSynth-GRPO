Bob forgot to use a strong key for Alice's secret messageâ€”he padded it with null bytes for AES-ECB. Can you recover the plaintext from 4e37ab8cd081e320ffd7395761ff284c?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{dmltymqq}
ciphertext: 4e37ab8cd081e320ffd7395761ff284c
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
