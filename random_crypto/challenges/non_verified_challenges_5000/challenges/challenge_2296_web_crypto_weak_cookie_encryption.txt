The admin encrypted a secret flag with AES-ECB, using your 3-byte password padded with nulls as the key. Can you retrieve the flag from 96dd3e8d49a2c0798595122bc90f077a?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{23u0du5o}
ciphertext: 96dd3e8d49a2c0798595122bc90f077a
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
