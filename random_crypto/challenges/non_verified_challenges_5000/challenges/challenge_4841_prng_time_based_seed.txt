A mysterious message encrypted at midnight awaits you. Can you recover the original text from this 666c70bc7b6c67ed686866ea6f7d by unraveling the Time-based PRNG cipher?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 50139)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 13:01:32 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
