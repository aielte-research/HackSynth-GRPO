A secret clubâ€™s treasure location was encrypted with an Autokey cipher. Can you recover the message from this mysterious ciphertext? nh qyku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{7zgjn0ld}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7hnww0lq}
ciphertext: nh qyku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{7zgjn0ld}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: fumy
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
