Intercepted at midnight, the message is secured by a PRNG seeded with the exact time sent. Can you decrypt 666c28b87b7379e86b3538e9777d and reveal the secret?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 82993)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:05:30 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
