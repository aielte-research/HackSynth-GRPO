An intercepted spy message, suspected encrypted with a weak LFSR stream cipher, hides the meeting location. Decrypt the following to find the rendezvous: 987f9f74857696759b75866bcc6e

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[20370, 10185, 5092, 2546, 34041, 49788, 57662, 61599, 63567, 64551]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ehfefxx2}
ciphertext: 987f9f74857696759b75866bcc6e
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[20370, 10185, 5092, 2546, 34041, 49788, 57662, 61599, 63567, 64551]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
