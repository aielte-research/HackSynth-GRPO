We found a message encrypted with AES-ECB, but the key was too short and padded with null bytes. Can you recover the plaintext from b6ec9e18f369b3a3c01a950d1849b9c9?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{bu2xbv8o}
ciphertext: b6ec9e18f369b3a3c01a950d1849b9c9
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
