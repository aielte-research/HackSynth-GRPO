A secret key encoded our treasure's location using an Autokey cipher. Crack the message below to find it: ca vyku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{4nvkx9nl}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{4vcxg9ny}
ciphertext: ca vyku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{4nvkx9nl}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: unry
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
