Bob encrypted his password using AES-ECB with a key shorter than 16 bytes, null-padded. Recover his key from the ciphertext: fe027082e2adec26899550c39fc03917


An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{tdknfvhk}
ciphertext: fe027082e2adec26899550c39fc03917
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
