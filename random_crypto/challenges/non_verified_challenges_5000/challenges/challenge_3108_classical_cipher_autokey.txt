A rogue agent left a secret contact address encrypted with an Autokey cipher. Can you decrypt their message and discover the meeting point?gm bipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{c1bewb8k}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{j1onwo8h}
ciphertext: gm bipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{c1bewb8k}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: yzx
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
