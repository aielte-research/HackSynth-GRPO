A rival hacker encoded the secret flag using their predictable custom RNG. Can you recover the flag from the ciphertext below, knowing they used LCG Predictability? 6279c6997f64c9993464d4cb7368

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 83288514
  - Multiplier: 4966875
  - Increment: 58063133
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [26554589, 23610500, 65961605, 72535220, 49722635] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qng0qs5w}
ciphertext: 6279c6997f64c9993464d4cb7368
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
