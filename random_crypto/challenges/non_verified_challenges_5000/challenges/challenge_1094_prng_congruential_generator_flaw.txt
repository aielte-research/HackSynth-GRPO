While testing a casino slot machine, you intercept a message encrypted with the internal number generator. Can you reveal the jackpot code? Ciphertext: 0da9795110b17b0704a76f0318b8

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1814838505
  - Multiplier: 1578130681
  - Increment: 1656789891
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [963245347, 838819768, 1136147759, 1268356345, 1146300741] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{tc1obw5s}
ciphertext: 0da9795110b17b0704a76f0318b8
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
