The hacker intercepted a secret message, but itâ€™s encrypted with a weak LFSR-based cipher. Can you exploit the flaw and recover the original plaintext from 9e56995d83588d5c9e59c8488d47?

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[60188, 30094, 15047, 7523, 3761, 1880, 33708, 49622, 57579, 61557]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{buffc0ru}
ciphertext: 9e56995d83588d5c9e59c8488d47
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[60188, 30094, 15047, 7523, 3761, 1880, 33708, 49622, 57579, 61557]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
