Intercepted rebel message qc oipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{dshblube} uses an Autokey cipher. The keyâ€™s first word is the codename of their leader. Can you recover the plaintext?


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
