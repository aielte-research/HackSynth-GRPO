An intern encrypted two secret messages to HQ with AES-GCM but reused the same nonce. Intercepted ciphertexts: ciphertext1:965380dec7dc457c5cc6fff2c9bd, ciphertext2: 845788ca9c85503353c7e5b090e0ada6c2ac. Can you recover both plaintexts?

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{0foannb8}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:965380dec7dc457c5cc6fff2c9bd, ciphertext2: 845788ca9c85503353c7e5b090e0ada6c2ac
tag1: db23fdd9e5b68ee0e41f1572ac26baff
tag2: 22a9c6ef84ca816fdbf7b4e28cd51946
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: f9471f1bb217fbcf0af84991
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
