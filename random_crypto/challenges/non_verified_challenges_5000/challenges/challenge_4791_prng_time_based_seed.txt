Intercepted at midnight, this message was encrypted using a PRNG seeded with the senderâ€™s Unix timestamp. Can you recover its secret? Ciphertext: 666c23d27b6c3482786835cc6b7d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 70415)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 13:00:22 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
