Intercepted spy notes contain the codeword “Aegis”. One coded message remains: fd tipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{5cajpmhh}. Can you decrypt it using the Autokey cipher and find the hidden meeting place?


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{5jnspzet}
ciphertext: fd tipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{5cajpmhh}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: xqp
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
