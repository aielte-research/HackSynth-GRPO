An intern used an insecure LFSR-based cipher to encrypt the boss's password. Recover the password from the leaked ciphertext: 42f345f85ff613f051f650ac40e2


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[32599, 16299, 40917, 20458, 10229, 37882, 18941, 9470, 37503, 18751]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{i7ouit3d}
ciphertext: 42f345f85ff613f051f650ac40e2
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[32599, 16299, 40917, 20458, 10229, 37882, 18941, 9470, 37503, 18751]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
