The intern encrypted the flag using AES-ECB, padding their tiny key with null bytes. Can you uncover the flag from ef0a97e2b58fee0810a606e59e68ae55?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{2tttuq5n}
ciphertext: ef0a97e2b58fee0810a606e59e68ae55
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
