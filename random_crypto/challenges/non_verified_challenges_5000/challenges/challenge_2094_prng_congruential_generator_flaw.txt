Hackers intercepted Bob’s message encoded with his homemade LCG-based cipher. Can you predict his next message fragment from the ciphertext? Here’s what they got: 66648ef57b61d7a7757f88a23875


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 11607941
  - Multiplier: 6498296
  - Increment: 3975498
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [11585217, 1314655, 6221195, 8711462, 9543686] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{i85uwg08}
ciphertext: 66648ef57b61d7a7757f88a23875
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
