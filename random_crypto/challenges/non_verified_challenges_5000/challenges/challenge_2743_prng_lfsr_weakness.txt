A suspicious message intercepted from a rogue satellite uses a flawed stream cipher. Can you recover its contents from the ciphertext below? c4abc3a0d9b2ceb4d0aad1a9c6ba


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ulsrmsnd}
ciphertext: c4abc3a0d9b2ceb4d0aad1a9c6ba
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[7728, 36632, 51084, 25542, 45539, 22769, 11384, 5692, 35614, 17807]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
