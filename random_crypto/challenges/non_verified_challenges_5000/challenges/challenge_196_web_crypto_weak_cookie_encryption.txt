The admin used AES-ECB with a weak, short password for encryption, padding the key with null bytes. Can you recover the flag from this ciphertext: 71304ec4cdf9a70160386179e4fce7b2?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{zdob2gnu}
ciphertext: 71304ec4cdf9a70160386179e4fce7b2
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
