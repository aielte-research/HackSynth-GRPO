The admin encrypted the flag with AES-ECB, using your short passphrase padded to 16 bytes. Recover the flag from this ciphertext: 3c9a855584afae90b2c81541004d4d5c

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{unomj8p5}
ciphertext: 3c9a855584afae90b2c81541004d4d5c
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
