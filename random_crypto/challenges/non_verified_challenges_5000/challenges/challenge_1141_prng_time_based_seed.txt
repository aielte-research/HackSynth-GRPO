A hacker intercepted a message encrypted with a PRNG seeded by the serverâ€™s clock. Can you recover the original text from the ciphertext below? 666d725b7b3774566a33624e307c


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 94427)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:33:50 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{6gjj2qr0}
ciphertext: 666d725b7b3774566a33624e307c
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 94427)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:33:50 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 70460.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
