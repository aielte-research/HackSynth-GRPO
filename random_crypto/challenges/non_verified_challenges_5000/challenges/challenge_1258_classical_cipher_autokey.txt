Agent X left a secret handoff code in the message below. It’s Autokey encrypted—can you recover the passphrase and decode it? Ciphertext: ho qgku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{ye0rwqpk}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{gl0efqch}
ciphertext: ho qgku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{ye0rwqpk}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: zbmg
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
