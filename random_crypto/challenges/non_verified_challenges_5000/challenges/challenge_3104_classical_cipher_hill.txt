An old ledger conceals a hidden wallet key. To decipher its encrypted passphrase, you'll need to unravel the Hill cipher hiding behind this coded message: ykzsueglchrqansqobpjsvbovcdonjobkidlcpdlqscqwvtiegwmediuixtgugbolonprv

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: welcome to the ancient library. hidden within these words is your key:
