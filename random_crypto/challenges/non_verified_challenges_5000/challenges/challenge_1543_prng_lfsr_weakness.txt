An old hacker left a secret in a file, encrypted with an LFSR-based method. Can you exploit its weakness and recover the flag from this cipher: 276a20613a6d3532276b307f2a7b?

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[6374, 3187, 1593, 33564, 16782, 8391, 4195, 2097, 1048, 33292]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{kt4fmqyk}
ciphertext: 276a20613a6d3532276b307f2a7b
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[6374, 3187, 1593, 33564, 16782, 8391, 4195, 2097, 1048, 33292]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
