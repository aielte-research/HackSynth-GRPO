EvilCorp encrypted their secret launch code using a homegrown PRNG. Here's the intercepted ciphertext: 477bccf85a249dfd4827c5ec146a. Can you recover the plain text by predicting their next numbers?


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1819786487
  - Multiplier: 82583819
  - Increment: 748611734
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1143269790, 562572910, 1780844948, 978372589, 759392587] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{30bi0hs5}
ciphertext: 477bccf85a249dfd4827c5ec146a
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
