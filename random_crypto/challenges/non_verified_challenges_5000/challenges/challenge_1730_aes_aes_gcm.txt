The developer encrypted two different secrets with AES-GCM but accidentally reused the same nonce. Can you exploit this to recover both plaintexts? Hereâ€™s the output: ciphertext1:b327ea2ab03bb88c13bacbf93617, ciphertext2: a123e23eeb66bdcf49bccfa9324aa1b61a84

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{4vc4ippe}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:b327ea2ab03bb88c13bacbf93617, ciphertext2: a123e23eeb66bdcf49bccfa9324aa1b61a84
tag1: 0b52ac5ee5b764b50263932425251e91
tag2: 728b7bc0a02bdcbfb2c0904060e0bfd6
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 7698528948898efecfba5108
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
