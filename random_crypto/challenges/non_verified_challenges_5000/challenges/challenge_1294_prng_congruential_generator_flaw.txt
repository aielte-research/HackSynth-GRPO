An intern tried to secure the vault with a homemade RNG stream cipher. Can you recover the secret message hidden in 4d4a9025504dc3214e16c0344f5b?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 816767560
  - Multiplier: 549474184
  - Increment: 346840138
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [728196610, 225973938, 69376490, 100133818, 294416130] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{k2ce01vd}
ciphertext: 4d4a9025504dc3214e16c0344f5b
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
