Intercepted satellite data was encoded with an LFSR-based stream cipher. Decrypt the flag hidden in c488c383d99d9183da8cd0d1cf99 to expose the vulnerability in their system.


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[36872, 51204, 58370, 29185, 47360, 23680, 11840, 5920, 35728, 17864]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{y3gxhr5m}
ciphertext: c488c383d99d9183da8cd0d1cf99
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[36872, 51204, 58370, 29185, 47360, 23680, 11840, 5920, 35728, 17864]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
