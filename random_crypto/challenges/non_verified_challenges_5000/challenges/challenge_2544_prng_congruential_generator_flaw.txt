Intercepted messages from a rogue botnet use an old LCG-based cipher. Can you predict the next output and decrypt this suspicious communication? Ciphertext: 255583b23841d3e77b529ae73544

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 2001705324
  - Multiplier: 1781299502
  - Increment: 196117043
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [856069065, 1663917257, 1772974581, 494764433, 1336419837] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{x128kx2v}
ciphertext: 255583b23841d3e77b529ae73544
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
