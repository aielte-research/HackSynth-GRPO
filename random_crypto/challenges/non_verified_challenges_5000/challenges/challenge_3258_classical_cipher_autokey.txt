Intercepted in 1918, this coded message from an unknown agent baffles analysts. Can you decrypt the Autokey-enciphered text below? kd cipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{157upzlr}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{157bcile}
ciphertext: kd cipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{157upzlr}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: cqy
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
