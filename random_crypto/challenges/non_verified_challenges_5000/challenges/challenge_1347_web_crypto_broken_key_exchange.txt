Ali & Bea swapped secrets using Diffie-Hellman, but someone intercepted this encrypted message: a130d70d99e4e4cd0beca63abbf7. Can you recover their shared key and decrypt it?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 44 and Bob's public key is 38.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
