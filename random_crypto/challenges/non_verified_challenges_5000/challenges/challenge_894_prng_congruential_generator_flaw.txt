Intercepted wallet keys encrypted with a predictable pseudo-random stream. Can you recover the secrets from this 6c493100715169017e123a577358?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 347086104
  - Multiplier: 64070447
  - Increment: 240231278
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [165885279, 226220951, 89593719, 302491871, 344439063] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{t9ft7j0y}
ciphertext: 6c493100715169017e123a577358
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
