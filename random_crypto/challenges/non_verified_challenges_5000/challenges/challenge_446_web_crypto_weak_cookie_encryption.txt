Intercepted secret text was encrypted with AES-ECB. Rumor is, the key is oddly shortâ€”padded out with null bytes! Can you recover the message from 3d11bca07adda2821c72190c4f2e4abf?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7vht9fyn}
ciphertext: 3d11bca07adda2821c72190c4f2e4abf
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
