You intercepted a spy’s scrambled note. The agent’s codebook confirms they used the Autokey cipher. Can you uncover the secret message in hg agku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{iyydf3a7}?


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qflmf3n7}
ciphertext: hg agku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{iyydf3a7}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: ztwg
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
