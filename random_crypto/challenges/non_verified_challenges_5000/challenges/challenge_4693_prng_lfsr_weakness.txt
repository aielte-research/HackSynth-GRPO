Intercepted during a covert chat, this 76d571de6bd362d8298921de71c4 was protected by a stream cipher with a flawed LFSR. Recover the secret to reveal the culprit's identity.


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[58938, 29469, 47502, 23751, 11875, 5937, 2968, 34252, 17126, 8563]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{jra901ga}
ciphertext: 76d571de6bd362d8298921de71c4
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[58938, 29469, 47502, 23751, 11875, 5937, 2968, 34252, 17126, 8563]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
