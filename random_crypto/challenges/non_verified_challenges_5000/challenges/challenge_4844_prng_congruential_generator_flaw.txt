EvilCorp encrypted their secret plan with an LCG-based cipher. You intercepted this message: 67669a877a6e8187753f93813177. Can you break the sequence and reveal their plot?


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 596650856
  - Multiplier: 582865477
  - Increment: 439669230
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [510975258, 63048016, 349195510, 221747772, 179318050] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{dzgt5ha0}
ciphertext: 67669a877a6e8187753f93813177
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
