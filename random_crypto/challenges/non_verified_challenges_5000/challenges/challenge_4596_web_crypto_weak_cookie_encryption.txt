Intercepted files encrypted with AES-ECB; key was intended to be secret123, but it's null-padded to 16 bytes. Can you recover the flag from 8d7e25b029dcc77e9c1eb68eebf90d5a?


An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ksgj6zr2}
ciphertext: 8d7e25b029dcc77e9c1eb68eebf90d5a
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
