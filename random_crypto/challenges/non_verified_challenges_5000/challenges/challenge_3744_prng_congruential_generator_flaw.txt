The vault key was encrypted with a flawed random generator. Crack the sequence to recover the original text: 60efc5417de4dc5031b3d15e74fe


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1778862758
  - Multiplier: 150484568
  - Increment: 1238949044
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1537656466, 1022418522, 232101134, 736392144, 1211645048] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{gxv70uxr}
ciphertext: 60efc5417de4dc5031b3d15e74fe
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
