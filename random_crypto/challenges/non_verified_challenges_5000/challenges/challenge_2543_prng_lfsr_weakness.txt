Intercepted from an outdated satellite beacon, this b852bf59a551b307b547a85fb443 was generated by a flawed LFSR. Recover the original message and reveal the hidden coordinates.

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[63988, 31994, 15997, 7998, 36767, 51151, 58343, 61939, 30969, 48252]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{om9kyvaj}
ciphertext: b852bf59a551b307b547a85fb443
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[63988, 31994, 15997, 7998, 36767, 51151, 58343, 61939, 30969, 48252]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
