Decrypt our secret data! We used AES-ECB with a short passcode, padded with null bytes for the key. Hereâ€™s your ciphertext: 77737003114120b54c49be72175e41f0

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{cijz2doi}
ciphertext: 77737003114120b54c49be72175e41f0
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
