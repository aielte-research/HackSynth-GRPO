An intern encrypted secret data with AES-ECB, mistakenly using a short key padded with nulls. Recover the original message from 2ef7fdd92619fcf52aadcf85997dcb7d.

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{teg2v29v}
ciphertext: 2ef7fdd92619fcf52aadcf85997dcb7d
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
