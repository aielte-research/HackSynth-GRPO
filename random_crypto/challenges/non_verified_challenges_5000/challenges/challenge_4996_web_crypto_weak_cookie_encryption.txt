Decrypt Alice's secret in a02e20f278b097fe0d5ead758ce6486a. The AES-ECB key she used is small, awkwardly padded with null bytes.

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{fcadkn9j}
ciphertext: a02e20f278b097fe0d5ead758ce6486a
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
