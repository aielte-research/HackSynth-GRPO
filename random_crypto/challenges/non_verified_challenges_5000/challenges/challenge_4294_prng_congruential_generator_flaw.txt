A careless developer encrypted the admin password using an insecure random sequence. The intercepted message is belowâ€”can you recover the secret?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1645269379
  - Multiplier: 727837410
  - Increment: 413454900
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [903315305, 31542300, 270562303, 936900158, 706325581] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qhr9vi6f}
ciphertext: 23353dda3e2834cf7c2f358b2324
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
