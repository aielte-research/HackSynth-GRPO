A hacker left a taunting note encrypted with a flawed LCG cipher. Can you break their scheme and reveal the message? Ciphertext: 46e0c0e05bfdd8e94eeec8f04af1

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 2098958390
  - Multiplier: 2077285800
  - Increment: 1073547963
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [134480343, 1794501553, 1820364583, 1417232823, 667233003] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qynnbiwj}
ciphertext: 46e0c0e05bfdd8e94eeec8f04af1
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
