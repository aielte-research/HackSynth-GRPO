Mia encoded the launch code with an Autokey cipher and sent it via email. Can you recover the secret hidden in xo qipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{00d4o01f}?

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{00k4b01o}
ciphertext: xo qipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{00d4o01f}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: pbm
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
