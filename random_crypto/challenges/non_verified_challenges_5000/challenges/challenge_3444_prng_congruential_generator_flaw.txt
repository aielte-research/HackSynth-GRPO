An amateur coder tried hiding his wallet key using a homegrown cipher, but his LCG-based scheme proved weak. Crack the ciphertext: 6683286c7b962e3861db7c733592

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 230270813
  - Multiplier: 62209703
  - Increment: 46992714
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [93927663, 149943920, 99691634, 127200689, 186445759] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{yg3a45x5}
ciphertext: 6683286c7b962e3861db7c733592
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
