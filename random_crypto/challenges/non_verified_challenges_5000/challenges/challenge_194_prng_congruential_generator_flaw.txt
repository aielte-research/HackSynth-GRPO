A hacker used an insecure LCG to encrypt a secret. Can you break their 3b63a75e2676bf4a2876a80f6472 and reveal the hidden flag?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 2137535791
  - Multiplier: 841046987
  - Increment: 275868418
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1855706702, 440173691, 1176227222, 598268191, 1054397771] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{yysuyn69}
ciphertext: 3b63a75e2676bf4a2876a80f6472
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
