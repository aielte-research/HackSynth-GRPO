Agents exchanged secrets using Diffie-Hellman, but the message was intercepted. Can you recover the shared key and decrypt the secret: 0dead31484069580e55af72d8f27?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 100 and Bob's public key is 81.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
