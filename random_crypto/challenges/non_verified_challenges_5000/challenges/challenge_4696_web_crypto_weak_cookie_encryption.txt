An intern encrypted the secret with AES-ECB, padding their 3-byte key with nulls. Can you recover the original message from 56611800cd15c3e16b4e1010e69d23d6?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qbmdxcw4}
ciphertext: 56611800cd15c3e16b4e1010e69d23d6
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
