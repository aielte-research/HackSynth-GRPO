Someone encrypted the vault code with a program that uses the current time for randomness. Crack the message: 666c5df87b3009a965640fec327d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 86981)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:14:49 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{056ed3s2}
ciphertext: 666c5df87b3009a965640fec327d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 86981)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:14:49 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 15519.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
