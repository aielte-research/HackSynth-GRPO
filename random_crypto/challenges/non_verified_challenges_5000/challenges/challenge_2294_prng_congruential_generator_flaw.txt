A rogue bot encrypts messages with predictable randomness. Can you recover the secret after intercepting this ciphertext? 77a340666abf193976ad566270b2

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 381099573
  - Multiplier: 296694565
  - Increment: 311767170
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [349897431, 175209831, 347578026, 246538263, 95301] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{p88gbwca}
ciphertext: 77a340666abf193976ad566270b2
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
