An agent hid secret coordinates in a message, encrypted with a cipher seeded by a timestamp. Recover the plaintext from this 666c4ddc7b684dc935765bd26b7d to reveal the hidden location.


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 18402)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:59:04 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
