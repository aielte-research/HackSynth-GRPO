Decrypt the secret in f8a092c1b76b5c250e7e8ce603a75ab6; our lazy dev padded a 3-byte key with nulls to meet AES-ECB requirements. Can you recover the plaintext?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1924i0y5}
ciphertext: f8a092c1b76b5c250e7e8ce603a75ab6
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
