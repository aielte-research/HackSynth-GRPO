A secret meeting requires you to compute a shared key using Diffie-Hellman. The intercepted message 016a10aaec753031511d6401168f awaits your decryption skills.

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 38 and Bob's public key is 34.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
