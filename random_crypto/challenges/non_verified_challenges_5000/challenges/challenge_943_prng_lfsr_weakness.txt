An old chat log was "secured" with LFSR-based encryption. Can you recover the message from this weak cipher? The ciphertext is: 2e62296933742037207a2a667173

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[14774, 7387, 3693, 1846, 923, 461, 32998, 16499, 8249, 36892]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{zh9htbh9}
ciphertext: 2e62296933742037207a2a667173
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[14774, 7387, 3693, 1846, 923, 461, 32998, 16499, 8249, 36892]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
