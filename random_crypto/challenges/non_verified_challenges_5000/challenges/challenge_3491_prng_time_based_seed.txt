Intercepted last night: a secret agent's message encrypted with a Time-based PRNG. Can you unravel its secret code? Ciphertext: 666caf6d7b71bc3a3136a1636d7d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 63122)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:30:24 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qr016oim}
ciphertext: 666caf6d7b71bc3a3136a1636d7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 63122)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:30:24 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 52746.
