Intercepted data from a hackerâ€™s device was encrypted with AES. Can you recover the message hidden in ciphertext1:746b0b21072b50f19016f4fef8b4, ciphertext2: 746b0b21072d00a29b12ece6aab4?

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ha4xjokj}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:746b0b21072b50f19016f4fef8b4, ciphertext2: 746b0b21072d00a29b12ece6aab4
tag1: 92114bac9052044dd6376736f480f738
tag2: 1d458efda4da5a673399cc123c9ecfad
cipher: AES
mode: CCM
hint: AES-CCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 58ae488f1b7e0d7aa046c8
subtype: aes_ccm
archetype: aes
