The admin encrypted the flag using AES-ECB with a user-supplied key, padded with null bytes if too short. Can you recover the flag from 2f7dcf049583cde755ee7525feaeb15f?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ahjlh790}
ciphertext: 2f7dcf049583cde755ee7525feaeb15f
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
