An agent hid the code in a message encrypted using a time-based PRNG. The ciphertext is belowâ€”crack it before the time window closes: 666c9b527b6c944470388d0c6f7d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 71721)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:29:09 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{lnqp8w9o}
ciphertext: 666c9b527b6c944470388d0c6f7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 71721)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:29:09 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 64053.
