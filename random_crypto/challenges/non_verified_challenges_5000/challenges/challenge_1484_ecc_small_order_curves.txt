A rogue engineer leaked classified coordinates, encrypting them with ECC on a suspected weak curve. Can you break the Public key: (80, 87) to recover the secret?


Curve equation: y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 3 (mod 97)
Generator G = (3, 6), group order ~ 5
Find d such that d*G = PublicKey.The flag format is flag{private_key}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{3}
ciphertext: Public key: (80, 87)
cipher: ECC - small_order_curves
hint: A small prime field with small group order means discrete log can be brute-forced easily.
necessary_info: Curve equation: y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 3 (mod 97)
Generator G = (3, 6), group order ~ 5
Find d such that d*G = PublicKey.The flag format is flag{private_key}
extra_info: Private key: d=3
We used p=97, a=2, b=3, G=(3, 6), group order=5
subtype: small_order_curves
archetype: ecc
