A hacker intercepted coordinates but encrypted them using a classic matrix cipher. Can you recover the original message from this Hill-encoded ciphertext? eapamatxthrynniknryrbjnelcvcqtnrieunnvunswwarffisaomrleofdnyagmcklajkb

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: welcome to the ancient library. hidden within these words is your key:
