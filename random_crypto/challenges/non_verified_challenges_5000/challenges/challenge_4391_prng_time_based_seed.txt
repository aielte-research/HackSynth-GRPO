An encrypted message, generated by a device at midnight using a time-dependent PRNG, hides the vault code. Can you recover it from 666c087e7b67016e34720e73317d?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 51153)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:51:07 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ghw4rgj1}
ciphertext: 666c087e7b67016e34720e73317d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 51153)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:51:07 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 26905.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
