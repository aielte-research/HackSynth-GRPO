An agent's secret message was intercepted. Rumor says it's XOR-encrypted. Can you reveal the hidden text in this cipher? stringA: 2508132a4a171827065c022f4d44 stringB: 4364724d316e774f316c37473939

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{yoh705ht}
cipher: XOR
ciphertext: stringA: 2508132a4a171827065c022f4d44 stringB: 4364724d316e774f316c37473939
hint: XOR is undone by XORing again with the same key. (A XOR B = C â‡’ C XOR B = A)
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: Both strings are in hex. XOR the two provided hex strings to recover the flag.
subtype: XOR
archetype: classical_cipher
