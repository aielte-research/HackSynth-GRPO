A hacker intercepted a secret message sent between spies. Itâ€™s encrypted with an Autokey cipher. Can you reveal the original text from this ciphertext? nh ripu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{pvv33jlp}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{wie33jym}
ciphertext: nh ripu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{pvv33jlp}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: fun
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
