An intern encrypted the flag with AES-ECB, but used the password 'kitty' as the key, padding with null bytes. Recover the plaintext from this ciphertext: 747dafdbd21a8b9a2e5ee60170859f11

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{as5wjr0y}
ciphertext: 747dafdbd21a8b9a2e5ee60170859f11
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
