An encrypted message was generated at midnight using a time-dependent PRNG. Can you recover the original text from 666d75e27b3560f577787cf56e7c?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 89367)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:37:31 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{4tpwyhpn}
ciphertext: 666d75e27b3560f577787cf56e7c
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 89367)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:37:31 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 70789.
