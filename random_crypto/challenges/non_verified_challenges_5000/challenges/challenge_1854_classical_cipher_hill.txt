An old diary contains the encoded word “gwdysocjilxgansustpvqtfgtsviztsteyrtkzrtwcuewxluoikekteeitrkqhthteshmp” left by a mathematician. Legend says the numbers hold the key—can you uncover the original message using the Hill cipher?

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: welcome to the ancient library. hidden within these words is your key:
