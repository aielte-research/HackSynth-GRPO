An old hard drive was encrypted using AES-XTS. Recover the original message hiding in the data: ciphertext1:abc46043a5e0a0debdd680ebaecd044f, ciphertext2: a39bf85e12d932cc1540c528bccea819c932d5897dd7762a73b8080353af3dcf


The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{uqecrzwr}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:abc46043a5e0a0debdd680ebaecd044f, ciphertext2: a39bf85e12d932cc1540c528bccea819c932d5897dd7762a73b8080353af3dcf
cipher: AES-XTS
hint: AES-XTS with tweak reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The tweak used for both encryptions is: d631cad08ff2e4aaa6a968688bd01de7
subtype: aes_xts
archetype: aes
