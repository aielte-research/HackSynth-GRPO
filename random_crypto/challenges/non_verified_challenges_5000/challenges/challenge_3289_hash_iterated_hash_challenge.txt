An encrypted password, hashed using SHA-256, was found in a hacker's notes. Can you recover the original password from the ciphertext below? 2baba03f2fc856ab3885ca7b74460f1c1a23d36bc35bbb35996a803b131148ae

The secret is only 4 characters (a-z, 0-9).
The flag format is flag{secret}
The hashing process was:
hash = secret
for _ in range(5):
    hash = hashlib.sha256(hash.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
