Intercepted from a rogue agent: pv eiku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{qy0254vm}â€”their orders are hidden with an Autokey cipher. Can you recover the secret message?


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{yf0254iv}
ciphertext: pv eiku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{qy0254vm}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
