An intercepted spy message uses a flawed LFSR stream cipher. Intelligence believes 917296798c6d806c947d806a8463 hides the drop location. Can you recover the plaintext?

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[31075, 15537, 7768, 36652, 51094, 58315, 29157, 47346, 56441, 60988]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{swrccwts}
ciphertext: 917296798c6d806c947d806a8463
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[31075, 15537, 7768, 36652, 51094, 58315, 29157, 47346, 56441, 60988]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
