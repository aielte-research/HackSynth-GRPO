A rogue script generates session keys using a predictable LCG sequence. Recover the next key given only this intercepted ciphertext: 322ded5b2f29bb0a6325ee51653c

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1496149663
  - Multiplier: 793006430
  - Increment: 223999785
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [94641521, 323006097, 1363599632, 261632925, 480540391] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{h767dbm1}
ciphertext: 322ded5b2f29bb0a6325ee51653c
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
