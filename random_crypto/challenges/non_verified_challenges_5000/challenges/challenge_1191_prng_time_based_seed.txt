Agent Zero encoded the coordinates with a time-seeded cipher. Recover the plaintext from 666c77637b617c6731737c6c767d to reach the secret location before midnight.

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 94297)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:35:02 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ajc1sjhv}
ciphertext: 666c77637b617c6731737c6c767d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 94297)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:35:02 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 5636.
