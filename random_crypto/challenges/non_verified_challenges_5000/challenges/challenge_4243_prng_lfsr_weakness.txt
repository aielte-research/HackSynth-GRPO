Agent Nova sent a secret using an LFSR-based stream cipher, but rumors say its key isn't secure. Recover her message from this intercepted ciphertext: de39d932c363d537d63ec9318e28

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[22380, 43958, 21979, 10989, 5494, 2747, 34141, 49838, 57687, 28843]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{6mbnkqd6}
ciphertext: de39d932c363d537d63ec9318e28
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[22380, 43958, 21979, 10989, 5494, 2747, 34141, 49838, 57687, 28843]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
