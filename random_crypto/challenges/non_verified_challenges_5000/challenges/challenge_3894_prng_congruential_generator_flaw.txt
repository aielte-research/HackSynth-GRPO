Jane found her friend's secret note encrypted with an LCG-based cipher. Can you predict the next steps and reveal the hidden message? Ciphertext: 2a5fb8963701bb893a54adc22f4e

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1750794521
  - Multiplier: 1443573869
  - Increment: 1135512935
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [496224800, 990388217, 1129614574, 1695643434, 206334782] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{2bxvgt3c}
ciphertext: 2a5fb8963701bb893a54adc22f4e
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
