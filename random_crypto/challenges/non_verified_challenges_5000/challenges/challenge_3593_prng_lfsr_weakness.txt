Intercepted spy traffic was encrypted with a faulty LFSR-based stream cipher. Can you recover the secret message from this suspicious ciphertext? 5df45aff40a959f441f448a00ce5


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1blzls87}
ciphertext: 5df45aff40a959f441f448a00ce5
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[25422, 12711, 39123, 52329, 58932, 29466, 47501, 56518, 61027, 30513]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
