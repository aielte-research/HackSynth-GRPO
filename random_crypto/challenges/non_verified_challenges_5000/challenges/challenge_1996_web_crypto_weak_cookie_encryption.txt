Intercepted secret launched with AES-ECB, but we padded its tiny key with nulls. Can you recover it? Ciphertext: fb169dcd6730a4104113d0c4c4a57efe

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{r5v7o1b4}
ciphertext: fb169dcd6730a4104113d0c4c4a57efe
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
