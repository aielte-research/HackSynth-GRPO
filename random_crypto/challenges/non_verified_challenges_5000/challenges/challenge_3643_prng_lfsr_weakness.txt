An intercepted spy message claims to be unbreakable. Can you exploit the LFSR weakness and recover the flag from this ciphertext? bb64bc6fa639ef3ba967a960aa75

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{123tothw}
ciphertext: bb64bc6fa639ef3ba967a960aa75
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[8855, 4427, 2213, 33874, 16937, 41236, 53386, 59461, 29730, 47633]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
