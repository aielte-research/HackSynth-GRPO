A rogue developer left an encrypted message about a hidden wallet passphrase. Can you decrypt fh dipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{zgcw1471} using the Autokey cipher and retrieve the clues?

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{gtlw1471}
ciphertext: fh dipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{zgcw1471}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: xuz
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
