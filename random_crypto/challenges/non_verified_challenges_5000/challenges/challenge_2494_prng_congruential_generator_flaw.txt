An overconfident developer encrypted this flag with their homemade LCG cipher. The ciphertext is belowâ€”can you predict the future and recover the flag? 6c2e23c3712b21c26e7338d6793f


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 315359712
  - Multiplier: 253700985
  - Increment: 174569121
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [223747431, 127467216, 230893713, 157681386, 286950555] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{icfd1zrs}
ciphertext: 6c2e23c3712b21c26e7338d6793f
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
