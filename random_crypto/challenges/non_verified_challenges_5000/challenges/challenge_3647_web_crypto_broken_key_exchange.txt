An intercepted exchange between agents reveals their secret using Diffie-Hellman. Recover the shared key and decrypt 819aa1760c00ea86a24572202e32 to unveil their plan.


The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 77 and Bob's public key is 39.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
