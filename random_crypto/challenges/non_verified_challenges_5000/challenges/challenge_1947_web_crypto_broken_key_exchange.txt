A secret key was exchanged over an insecure network using Diffie-Hellman. The intercepted message is: 52f020476052a8e262ff0a333636. Recover the shared secret.

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 45 and Bob's public key is 80.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
