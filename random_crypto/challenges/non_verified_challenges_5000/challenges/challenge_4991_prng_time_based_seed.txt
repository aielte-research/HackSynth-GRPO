Someone encrypted the launch codes at midnight using a time-based PRNG cipher. Can you recover them from the ciphertext below? 666c1ec67b6d1596727905d2327d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 93545)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 13:05:07 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{mj7ryzs2}
ciphertext: 666c1ec67b6d1596727905d2327d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 93545)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 13:05:07 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 32673.
