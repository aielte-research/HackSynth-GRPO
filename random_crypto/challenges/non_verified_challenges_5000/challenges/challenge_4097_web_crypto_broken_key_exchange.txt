Alice and Bob exchanged keys over an insecure channel. Eve intercepted a message: 8d0e2cd92d811057cf52626664df. Can you recover their shared secret using the captured transmission?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 35 and Bob's public key is 59.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

flag: flag{jvwa0jjt}
ciphertext: 8d0e2cd92d811057cf52626664df
cipher: Diffie-Hellman
hint: The prime used in this key exchange is small. You can recover the private key by brute-force.
