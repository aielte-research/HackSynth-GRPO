At midnight, a hacker sent you 666cd6ca7b64d89f323184c46f7d, encrypted by their clock-driven cipher. Recover the secret before time runs out!

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 51797)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:27:57 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{do2213io}
ciphertext: 666cd6ca7b64d89f323184c46f7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 51797)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:27:57 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 47021.
