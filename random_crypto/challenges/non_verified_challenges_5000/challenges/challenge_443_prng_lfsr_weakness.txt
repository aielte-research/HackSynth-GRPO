Agent K intercepted a suspicious transmission encrypted with a faulty LFSR stream cipher. Analyze 2641214a3b5b2240345739187350 to uncover the hidden message before midnight.


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{vbmtzy53}
ciphertext: 2641214a3b5b2240345739187350
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[47009, 23504, 11752, 5876, 2938, 1469, 734, 367, 183, 32859]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
