The vault lock uses an LCG-based cipher. I intercepted this message: 7df7352060e2222f6ef23a2c79e6. Can you predict the next code to open it?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1382877144
  - Multiplier: 304042363
  - Increment: 368584649
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [765768690, 615372191, 754561054, 453518763, 595359770] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{yvhuinkb}
ciphertext: 7df7352060e2222f6ef23a2c79e6
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
