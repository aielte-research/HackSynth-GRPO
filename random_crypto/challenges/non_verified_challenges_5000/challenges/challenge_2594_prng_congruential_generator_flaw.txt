A hacker left an encrypted note using a faulty random number generator. Can you recover the secret knowing their method is predictable? Ciphertext: 43d132dd5ec467d457dc3fd556c0

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1291356914
  - Multiplier: 232687015
  - Increment: 655011415
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [293276057, 796441220, 267720443, 946229920, 1222976693] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{y4nralos}
ciphertext: 43d132dd5ec467d457dc3fd556c0
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
