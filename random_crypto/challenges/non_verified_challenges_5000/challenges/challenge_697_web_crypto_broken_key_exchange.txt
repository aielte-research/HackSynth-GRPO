Agents traded secrets using Diffie-Hellman, but only the 10c969e0a3c5a7855f7a3a2bfbed was intercepted. Recover their shared key to reveal the hidden message.

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 17 and Bob's public key is 25.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
