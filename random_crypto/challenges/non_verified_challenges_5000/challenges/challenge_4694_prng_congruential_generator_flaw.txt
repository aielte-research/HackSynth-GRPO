The vaultâ€™s passcode was encrypted using a flawed random number generator. Crack the code by predicting its sequence from the ciphertext below: 272930803a7238843b7c669e2d38


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1950725182
  - Multiplier: 745560701
  - Increment: 829072649
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1439907434, 1346305183, 977270772, 742472339, 531497112] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7icz97yl}
ciphertext: 272930803a7238843b7c669e2d38
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
