The secret agency reused a nonce in their AES-GCM encryption. Intercepted messages include ciphertext1:68a6a0d071bb4f99bf48bb3e4242, ciphertext2: 7aa2a8c42ab344dce44fa566511f0ef1221a; can you exploit their mistake to reveal the plaintext?

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{axe5hjxr}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:68a6a0d071bb4f99bf48bb3e4242, ciphertext2: 7aa2a8c42ab344dce44fa566511f0ef1221a
tag1: 0945bfe18804fd2274bbf4b35a53aeb4
tag2: 20dc798531051dffdc0d576351ad3e1c
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 1d8c465867f839ac256d0daf
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
