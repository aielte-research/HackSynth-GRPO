An intercepted satellite message, encrypted with a flawed LFSR implementation, holds the passphrase for a hidden vault. Can you recover it from: fd12fa19e012ac08f34af046ea03

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[63645, 64590, 32295, 48915, 57225, 28612, 47074, 56305, 28152, 14076]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{l7vh4k8q}
ciphertext: fd12fa19e012ac08f34af046ea03
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[63645, 64590, 32295, 48915, 57225, 28612, 47074, 56305, 28152, 14076]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
