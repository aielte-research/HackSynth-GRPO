Intercepted from a rival group, this message uses a flawed LFSR cipher. Can you exploit its weakness to recover their plan? Ciphertext: bb58bc53a642b145ec40ba5ee949

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{vlq1tgj4}
ciphertext: bb58bc53a642b145ec40ba5ee949
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[54096, 27048, 13524, 39530, 19765, 42650, 54093, 59814, 29907, 47721]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
