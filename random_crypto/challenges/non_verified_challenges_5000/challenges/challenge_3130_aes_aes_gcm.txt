Agent’s notes: Both secret messages were sent using AES-GCM—but HQ mistakenly reused the nonce. Can you exploit this and recover the keys? Ciphertexts: ciphertext1:6f37dceda247aabe76ef86c5d4f6, ciphertext2: 7d33d4f9f91faaa770eac7ddd1ab1a629c84


The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1s9hj58d}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:6f37dceda247aabe76ef86c5d4f6, ciphertext2: 7d33d4f9f91faaa770eac7ddd1ab1a629c84
tag1: 3ea45f30adb0955c72978774ea171430
tag2: 6ad32a44c06b6611972f82b586de23c1
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: a887bfdb46ab64ca57f00b3e
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
