Intercepted files reveal hidden plans, protected by AES-ECB. Decrypt d04e96b4c103fe0f26e4185e9707b2c6 with the padded secret key "magic".

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{xlc3jpvo}
ciphertext: d04e96b4c103fe0f26e4185e9707b2c6
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
