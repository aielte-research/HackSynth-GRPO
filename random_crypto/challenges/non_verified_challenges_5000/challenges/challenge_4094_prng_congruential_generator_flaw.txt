The vault's lock runs on pseudo-random codes. I intercepted this recent output: 61262b217c203c706f293a3c6837. Can you reveal the next sequence to break in?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 605465886
  - Multiplier: 376193065
  - Increment: 281658514
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [279485236, 389133404, 604893894, 406578004, 575700716] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

flag: flag{jv6hcpzo}
ciphertext: 61262b217c203c706f293a3c6837
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
