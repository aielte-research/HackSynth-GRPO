An old hacker's diary is encrypted with a stream cipher. Luckily, rumors say the LFSR Weakness was never patched. Can you recover the secret message? e011e71afd15b61ee212b548f400

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{h0cdo35r}
ciphertext: e011e71afd15b61ee212b548f400
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[63174, 64355, 32177, 16088, 40812, 53174, 26587, 13293, 6646, 3323]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
