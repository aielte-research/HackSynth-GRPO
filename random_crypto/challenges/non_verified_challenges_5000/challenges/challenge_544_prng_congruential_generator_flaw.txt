Our vaultâ€™s lock relies on an LCG-based scheme. Unfortunately, someone leaked a sequence. Can you break the pattern and recover the flag from this ciphertext? 4fb37e0c52b46d1d1cbc741b11a2

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 987224042
  - Multiplier: 315259321
  - Increment: 216272946
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [388136977, 126993031, 238179155, 458521347, 476105347] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{krv5ckp8}
ciphertext: 4fb37e0c52b46d1d1cbc741b11a2
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
