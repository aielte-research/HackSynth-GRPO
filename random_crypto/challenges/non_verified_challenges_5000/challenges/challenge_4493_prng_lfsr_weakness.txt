An intercepted radio signal uses a flawed stream cipher based on a weak LFSR. Analysts need to recover the original message from this ciphertext: d298d593cf92d593c19387c0d789

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[53950, 59743, 62639, 31319, 15659, 40597, 20298, 42917, 54226, 27113]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{fagug34c}
ciphertext: d298d593cf92d593c19387c0d789
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[53950, 59743, 62639, 31319, 15659, 40597, 20298, 42917, 54226, 27113]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
