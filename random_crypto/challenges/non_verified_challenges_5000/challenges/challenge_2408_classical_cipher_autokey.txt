Intercepted transmission between rival hackers: the passphrase is hidden in their favorite meme. Can you decrypt the secret using the Autokey cipher? Ciphertext: id tpku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{fz6sc9xz}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ng6fl9xm}
ciphertext: id tpku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{fz6sc9xz}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: aqpp
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
