An archived server log contains a secret message encrypted years ago using a timestamp-seeded PRNG cipher. Can you reveal its contents? Ciphertext: 666d749e7b30259e7a657088767c

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 73613)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:48:55 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{10gzdeqv}
ciphertext: 666d749e7b30259e7a657088767c
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 73613)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:48:55 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 71161.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
