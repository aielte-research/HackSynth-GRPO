Your encrypted backup drive stores the master flag. Only AES-XTS stood between you and itâ€¦ until now. The ciphertext is: ciphertext1:6ae78faf544ebd1ff79106a0444db060, ciphertext2: b488bbe34452eed49b4cda25fc01e1fea75e5e96c5127e8d86ccedb444975487.

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{5l79fjzq}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:6ae78faf544ebd1ff79106a0444db060, ciphertext2: b488bbe34452eed49b4cda25fc01e1fea75e5e96c5127e8d86ccedb444975487
cipher: AES-XTS
hint: AES-XTS with tweak reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The tweak used for both encryptions is: 9b76fba1642b099bcfadcd3f7fba3775
subtype: aes_xts
archetype: aes
