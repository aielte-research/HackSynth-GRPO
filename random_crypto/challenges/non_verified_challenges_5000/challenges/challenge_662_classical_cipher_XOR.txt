Intercepted during a digital heist, this message was scrambled with an XOR cipher. Unmask the original secret from the garbled ciphertext: stringA: 333c1216341c4e085a142e091f1f stringB: 555073714f7036696d64426a7962

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{lxa7plcf}
cipher: XOR
ciphertext: stringA: 333c1216341c4e085a142e091f1f stringB: 555073714f7036696d64426a7962
hint: XOR is undone by XORing again with the same key. (A XOR B = C â‡’ C XOR B = A)
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: Both strings are in hex. XOR the two provided hex strings to recover the flag.
subtype: XOR
archetype: classical_cipher
