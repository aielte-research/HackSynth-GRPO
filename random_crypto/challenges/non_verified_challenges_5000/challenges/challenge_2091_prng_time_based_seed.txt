Someone encrypted their login with a timestamp-seeded PRNG. Recover the plaintext, knowing the method and 666c21757b312c686a3229736a7d.

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 19214)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:57:30 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1lzj2iaj}
ciphertext: 666c21757b312c686a3229736a7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 19214)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:57:30 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 16402.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
