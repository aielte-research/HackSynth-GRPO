An intercepted message labeled "Project Hydra" was encrypted with AES. Your task: recover its secret contents from this ciphertext fragment: ciphertext1:52b608ca881bc7bdfd9cd461be3d, ciphertext2: 52b608ca8849d7f4ae859a38f53d.

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{0bxbp43r}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:52b608ca881bc7bdfd9cd461be3d, ciphertext2: 52b608ca8849d7f4ae859a38f53d
tag1: f20a076b4157f7ad9493349d56c9fad8
tag2: a34cdc57524fe7479b3df5fb42a9a7ca
cipher: AES
mode: CCM
hint: AES-CCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 278f5a90931ad0c4a7ab69
subtype: aes_ccm
archetype: aes
