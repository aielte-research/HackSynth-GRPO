A spy intercepts a secret key exchange using the Diffie-Hellman cipher. Use 687bbbad24507d352def9e9c86c1 to discover the shared secret.

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 11 and Bob's public key is 23.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{njjid20e}
ciphertext: 687bbbad24507d352def9e9c86c1
cipher: Diffie-Hellman
hint: The prime used in this key exchange is small. You can recover the private key by brute-force.
necessary_info: The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
