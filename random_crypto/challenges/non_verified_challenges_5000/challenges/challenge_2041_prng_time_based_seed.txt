A hacker encrypted the login key using a PRNG seeded with the system clock. Can you recover it from the ciphertext? 666c5dc37b6c5595357045c3617d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 23585)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:56:08 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{li15pyga}
ciphertext: 666c5dc37b6c5595357045c3617d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 23585)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:56:08 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 15524.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
