While sending secret files, the admin accidentally reused a nonce in AES-GCM. Both intercepted ciphertexts are shown: ciphertext1:8b8ddaedc778a0f25ab90f13e5a6, ciphertext2: 9989d2f99c60e6a152e41c45f4fbe3710bb4. Can you recover the plaintext?

The flag format is flag{...}

flag: flag{q5sf2gvp}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:8b8ddaedc778a0f25ab90f13e5a6, ciphertext2: 9989d2f99c60e6a152e41c45f4fbe3710bb4

tag2: a561d57b1e8f03acd29633b7f107eec3
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 09bb23a5bacfb7011aa96d78
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
