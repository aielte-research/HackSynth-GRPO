An intern encrypted the server password with an LCG Predictability cipher. Can you recover it from the intercepted ciphertext? Here it is: 726ed65d6f6ac54d2273d909707f

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1931000216
  - Multiplier: 570355524
  - Increment: 1014665706
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [49948746, 1758935098, 1780317546, 359571258, 650138642] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{hrw6qn3d}
ciphertext: 726ed65d6f6ac54d2273d909707f
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
