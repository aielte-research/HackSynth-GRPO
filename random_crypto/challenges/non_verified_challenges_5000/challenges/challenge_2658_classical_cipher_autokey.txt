Intercepted spy orders arrived, but HQ only knows an old Autokey cipher was used. Decode the urgent message below to reveal the mission:
zq vbku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{v76l50zm}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{d76s50mv}
ciphertext: zq vbku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{v76l50zm}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: rdrb
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
