Intercepted at midnight, this secret message is rumored to have used a timer-triggered cipher. Can you decrypt 666caaa27b62a5fd306da1ad717d before time runs out?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 81389)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:59:00 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{bn80mjhq}
ciphertext: 666caaa27b62a5fd306da1ad717d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 81389)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:59:00 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 52165.
