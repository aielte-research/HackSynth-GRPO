CryptoCorp encrypted their top-secret plans using AES-ECB, naively padding their short key with null bytes. Recover their secret from this ciphertext: f7f1a6873e3f7bef33aea9ac4fde4620

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{x9l4ecfw}
ciphertext: f7f1a6873e3f7bef33aea9ac4fde4620
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
