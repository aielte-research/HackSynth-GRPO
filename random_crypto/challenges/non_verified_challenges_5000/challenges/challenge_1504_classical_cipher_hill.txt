Intercepted instructions from a secret society were encoded with numbers. Can you decrypt their message using a Hill cipher matrix? Ciphertext: wkyfoerobaufnacgrktfvmexenuzddrkwetlvutleweqbqqnigyahskgluyvgcaqbtetjo

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: welcome to the ancient library. hidden within these words is your key:
