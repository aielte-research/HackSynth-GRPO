A hacker scrambled the treasure map using a secret PRNG cipher seeded with a critical timestamp. Can you recover the map from this ciphertext? 666c2f847b31269a32787f80637d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 42728)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:41:16 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
