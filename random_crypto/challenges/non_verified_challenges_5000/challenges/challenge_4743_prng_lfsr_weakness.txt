Intercepted radio traffic from a rogue satellite is encrypted. Analysts suspect a weak LFSR-based scheme was used. Can you recover the original message from 5e6f596443795c60566b50795d7e?

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[3828, 1914, 957, 478, 239, 119, 32827, 49181, 57358, 28679]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{zdcnhhze}
ciphertext: 5e6f596443795c60566b50795d7e
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[3828, 1914, 957, 478, 239, 119, 32827, 49181, 57358, 28679]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
