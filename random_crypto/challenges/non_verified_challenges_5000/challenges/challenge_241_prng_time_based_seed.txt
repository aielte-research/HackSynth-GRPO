A message, encrypted with a PRNG seeded by the serverâ€™s clock, awaits. Decode 666cf6987b6be5cf637ae4c8327d and reveal its contents before time runs out.


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 54818)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:43:28 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{kr0czs72}
ciphertext: 666cf6987b6be5cf637ae4c8327d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 54818)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:43:28 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 38911.
