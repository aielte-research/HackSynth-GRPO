The vault's access code is scrambled using a cipher seeded with last midnightâ€™s timestamp. Crack it to reveal the code: 666c50297b78543f77770026317d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 59830)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:13:42 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{xeqww1h1}
ciphertext: 666c50297b78543f77770026317d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 59830)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:13:42 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 12622.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
