Intercepted at midnight, this message hides its secret in the ticks of time. Can you decrypt the 666c592e7b795c316565413c307d before the clock resets?


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 80330)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:07:51 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ydxeeyu0}
ciphertext: 666c592e7b795c316565413c307d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 80330)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:07:51 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 14409.
