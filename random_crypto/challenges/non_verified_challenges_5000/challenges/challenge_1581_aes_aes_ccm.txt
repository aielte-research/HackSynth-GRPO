## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{hylgrmb8}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:93a7eb5dca2c38b381ac14bf429c, ciphertext2: 93a7eb5dca203bb49caf01ea1f9c
tag1: 2070c26cef29f255772470565208e1b9
tag2: d608d6d3a4f5e4cc698c03f85f314248
cipher: AES
mode: CCM
hint: AES-CCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 8f53bff732661b5798925b
subtype: aes_ccm
archetype: aes
