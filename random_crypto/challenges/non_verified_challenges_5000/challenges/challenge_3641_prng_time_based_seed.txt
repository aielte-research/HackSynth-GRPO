A hacker hid coordinates to the treasure in a message encrypted with a time-seeded PRNG. Can you recover the secret from this mysterious cipher: 666c61b47b7463b0797166b67a7d?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 71525)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:33:59 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
