Hackers intercepted Alice's secret message encrypted with AES-ECB. Rumor says she used a short key padded with null bytes. Can you recover it from d777561cc5c0b4ee5ff0e1356eb870bf?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{5khob5ky}
ciphertext: d777561cc5c0b4ee5ff0e1356eb870bf
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
