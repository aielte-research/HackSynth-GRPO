A secret alliance forms, exchanging keys in plain sight. Can you recover their shared secret and reveal the hidden message? Ciphertext: 39f02bd7f7c1013f9e65785e931b

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 53 and Bob's public key is 59.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{muhwtbnw}
ciphertext: 39f02bd7f7c1013f9e65785e931b
cipher: Diffie-Hellman
hint: The prime used in this key exchange is small. You can recover the private key by brute-force.
