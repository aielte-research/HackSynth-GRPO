The hacker left his secret message encrypted with a PRNG seeded by the time he ran his script. Can you recover the flag from this ciphertext: 666c65587b7132097277350a6b7d?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 11107)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:17:06 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
