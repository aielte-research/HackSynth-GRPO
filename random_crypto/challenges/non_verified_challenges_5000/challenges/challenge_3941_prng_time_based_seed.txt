An agent's secret message, encrypted with the labâ€™s time-based PRNG cipher, was intercepted. Recover the plain text from this ciphertext: 666c14637b760060766b1d75327d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 30006)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:40:55 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{vudvkhq2}
ciphertext: 666c14637b760060766b1d75327d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 30006)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:40:55 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 29956.
