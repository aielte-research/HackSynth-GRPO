Can you recover my secret flag? I encrypted it with AES-ECB, but my password was short, so I padded it with null bytes. Ciphertext: e2713ca1ce7e717558692fd2e3502719

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{fgujd7yv}
ciphertext: e2713ca1ce7e717558692fd2e3502719
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
