The hackerâ€™s diary entry is encrypted with an Autokey cipher. Find the secret keyword and decrypt: gt pqku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{y5u57jzc}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{g5b57wic}
ciphertext: gt pqku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{y5u57jzc}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: yglq
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
