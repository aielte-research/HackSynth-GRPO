Intercepted messages from an underground casino use the LCG Predictability cipher. Can you recover the roulette winnerâ€™s name from 5706a3264a1dbb2d071bfb330017?


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1176432537
  - Multiplier: 509315416
  - Increment: 557503695
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [951777480, 573056802, 839699871, 199087773, 411434670] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{wyl6q9r1}
ciphertext: 5706a3264a1dbb2d071bfb330017
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
