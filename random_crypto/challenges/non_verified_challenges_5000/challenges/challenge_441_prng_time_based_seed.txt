Intercepted at midnight, this message is encrypted with a time-based PRNG. Can you recover the secret hidden within 666c42677b65447662794d69367d?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 33136)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:48:10 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
