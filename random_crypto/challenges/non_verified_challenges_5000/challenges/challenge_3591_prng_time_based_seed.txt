An old system logs secrets using timestamps as keys. Recover the original message from this time-based PRNG cipher: 666ccd037b6cda0f777ac00a307d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 64445)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:32:53 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{lvkwzln0}
ciphertext: 666ccd037b6cda0f777ac00a307d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 64445)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:32:53 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 44132.
