The hacker group "RANDOM8" used their custom LCG-based cipher to encrypt a secret message. Can you predict the next output and recover the original text? 521ad6d94f01d8dd4d42ced8460b

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1094431586
  - Multiplier: 422046268
  - Increment: 1082117894
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [202724188, 674202480, 560174482, 564265084, 728155274] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{wocy4yfr}
ciphertext: 521ad6d94f01d8dd4d42ced8460b
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
