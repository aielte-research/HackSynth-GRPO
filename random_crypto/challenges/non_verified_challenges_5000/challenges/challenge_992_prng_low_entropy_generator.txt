Someone encrypted vital coordinates using a weak PRNG cipher. The ciphertext is belowâ€”can you recover the secret message? 666c61b47b6c69b06d7664b06f7d

The flag format is flag{...}
A random number generator was seeded using an 8-bit value (0-255). The first outputs of the generator are: [213, 11, 533, 37, 161, 244, 17, 56, 150, 376, 245, 119, 346, 477, 364, 287, 401, 269, 352, 234]. The next PRNG output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 593)

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{licmvdco}
ciphertext: 666c61b47b6c69b06d7664b06f7d
cipher: Low-entropy PRNG
hint: The PRNG seed space is small. You can try brute-forcing all possible seeds to reconstruct the sequence.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}

secret_num = rng.randint(0, 593)
extra_info: Since the seed has only 256 possible values, it can be brute-forced to recover the secret number and decrypt the flag.
subtype: low_entropy_generator
