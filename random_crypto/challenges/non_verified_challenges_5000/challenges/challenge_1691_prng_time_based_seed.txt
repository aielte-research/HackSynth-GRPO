Intercepted at midnight, this message hides a code behind watertight timings. Crack the 666d55407b6d40133969444f337c generated by a clock-tuned PRNG before time runs out!

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 85607)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:47:34 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
