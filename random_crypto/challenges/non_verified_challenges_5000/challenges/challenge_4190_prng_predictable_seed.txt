A careless web admin used a homebrewed PRNG-based cipher for secret messages. Can you crack the code and reveal the hidden flag? Ciphertext: 6be96ce276fd6cee3db269bc61f8


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 2**12)
A secret number was generated using Python's PRNG with a seed from 0 to 9,999. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{xak07d9l}
ciphertext: 6be96ce276fd6cee3db269bc61f8
cipher: Predictable PRNG
hint: The seed range is small enough for brute-force. Try recreating the PRNG sequence.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 2**12)
A secret number was generated using Python's PRNG with a seed from 0 to 9,999. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: If you can predict or brute-force the seed, you can reconstruct the PRNG output and decrypt the flag.
subtype: predictable_seed
archetype: prng
