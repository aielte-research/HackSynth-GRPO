An intern used AES-ECB to encrypt a secret, but padded a 5-byte key with null bytes. Recover the original secret from 118e63f1db2248b62c06f739f7d7837e.


An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{n5qtkwmn}
ciphertext: 118e63f1db2248b62c06f739f7d7837e
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
