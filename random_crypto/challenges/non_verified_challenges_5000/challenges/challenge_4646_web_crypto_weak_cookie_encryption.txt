Intercepted admin messages encrypted with AES-ECB. Rumor says the weak key was carelessly padded with null bytes. Can you recover the original plaintext from 0269d9ec65c63b3e56427fdcd4c774b7?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qd83dvg8}
ciphertext: 0269d9ec65c63b3e56427fdcd4c774b7
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
