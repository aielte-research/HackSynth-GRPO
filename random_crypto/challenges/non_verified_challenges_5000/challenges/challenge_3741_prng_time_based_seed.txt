An old clockmaker hides his secret blueprint using a cipher synchronized to a midnight timestamp. Crack the time-locked message: 666d599d7b364a80696a0d9d6e7c

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 99548)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:36:11 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7rzik5gn}
ciphertext: 666d599d7b364a80696a0d9d6e7c
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 99548)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:36:11 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 80122.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
