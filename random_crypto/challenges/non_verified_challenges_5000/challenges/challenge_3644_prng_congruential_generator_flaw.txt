Agent Zero encoded the launch code using his predictable LCG cipher. Crack the sequence he generated to reveal the secret: 72a995276ff696376ca0c37525b8

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 751919200
  - Multiplier: 502941797
  - Increment: 66798982
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [371674634, 344381080, 496830142, 365066556, 72829714] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{3bwxe751}
ciphertext: 72a995276ff696376ca0c37525b8
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
