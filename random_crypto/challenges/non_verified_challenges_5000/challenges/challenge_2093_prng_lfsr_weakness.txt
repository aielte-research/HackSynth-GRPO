Intercepted spy communications use a homemade stream cipher. Analysts suspect an LFSR weaknessâ€”can you recover the secret message from 89da8ed194879ac198d286c0decb?


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[55402, 27701, 46618, 56077, 60806, 63171, 64353, 32176, 48856, 57196]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1uwwdiv1}
ciphertext: 89da8ed194879ac198d286c0decb
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[55402, 27701, 46618, 56077, 60806, 63171, 64353, 32176, 48856, 57196]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
