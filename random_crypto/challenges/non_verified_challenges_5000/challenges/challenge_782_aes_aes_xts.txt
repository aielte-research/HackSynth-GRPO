## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{hg6vic7q}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:fb7e69c575401f4bfc9201179ff4e4e8, ciphertext2: 3404bfbb9cdc70a6aba415bcdb76ee45b578ceaed216daeb5ca62af3e831ec6e
cipher: AES-XTS
hint: AES-XTS with tweak reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The tweak used for both encryptions is: a028b4c0e483f27723382a835915bcda
subtype: aes_xts
archetype: aes
