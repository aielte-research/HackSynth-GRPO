The secret passcode was encrypted using an LCG-based method. Can you predict the next output and recover the flag from this ciphertext? 229b690d3f826b1f2ec0600b2d8a

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1302969051
  - Multiplier: 616732260
  - Increment: 728490861
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [251039523, 74818854, 303971562, 706277907, 412513587] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ucuj7hai}
ciphertext: 229b690d3f826b1f2ec0600b2d8a
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
