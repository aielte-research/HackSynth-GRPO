The vault's OTPs are generated by a Linear Congruential Generator. Recover the secret code from this intercepted ciphertext: 2c6ea8db3173b9ce3a6cf8d9227f

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1831961965
  - Multiplier: 713003049
  - Increment: 1356148670
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [530483895, 621447145, 1198087775, 905965345, 460565275] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qprpn1eh}
ciphertext: 2c6ea8db3173b9ce3a6cf8d9227f
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
