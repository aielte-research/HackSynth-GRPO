An agent encrypted the passcode using a time-seeded PRNG. All you have is the ciphertext below and the knowledge that timing is crucial: 666c62da7b6e64db777030c7797d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 78804)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:37:24 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
