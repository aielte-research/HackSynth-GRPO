Decrypt the intercepted message: 3a502a4267bd2a5b47c3a9fc4f0f257f. Rumor has it, the ancient vault's owner believed an 8-byte secret, padded with null bytes, was unbreakable in AES-ECB.

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{xxhvwli2}
ciphertext: 3a502a4267bd2a5b47c3a9fc4f0f257f
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
