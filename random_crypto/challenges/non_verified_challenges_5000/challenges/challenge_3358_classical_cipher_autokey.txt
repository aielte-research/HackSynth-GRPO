An intercepted spy note, encrypted with a forgotten method. Can you recover the Autokey and reveal the hidden orders within: pd nipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{2s678ocu}?

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{2z678blu}
ciphertext: pd nipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{2s678ocu}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: hqj
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
