The rogue admin secured the flag with an LCG-based stream cipher. Can you predict the next output and recover the message? Encrypted data: 06e518331bfe002c01bb0b2e0ff4

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1775946500
  - Multiplier: 151607
  - Increment: 148408367
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [680245723, 948480228, 1554122763, 1215983508, 1409619723] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{wyxa2rzo}
ciphertext: 06e518331bfe002c01bb0b2e0ff4
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
