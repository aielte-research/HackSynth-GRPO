Spies Alice and Bob used Diffie-Hellman to share secrets. Eavesdropper intercepted their encrypted message: e34bc9f699162b0f38c706f84a56. Can you recover their shared key and reveal the secret?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 39 and Bob's public key is 64.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{28fh842k}
ciphertext: e34bc9f699162b0f38c706f84a56
cipher: Diffie-Hellman
hint: The prime used in this key exchange is small. You can recover the private key by brute-force.
necessary_info: The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
