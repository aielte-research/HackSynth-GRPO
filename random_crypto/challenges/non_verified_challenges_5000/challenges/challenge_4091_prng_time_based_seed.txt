An old server left a secret message, encrypted using a time-based PRNG. Can you recover the original text from this mysterious ciphertext? 666cbe4e7b33eb5c6d35ad4b697d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 66813)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:44:14 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
