A hacker claims their random-number-based encryption is unbreakable. Can you reveal the original message from their 73ad5ed76eb607846fa008c37abc ciphertext?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 530449746
  - Multiplier: 201241237
  - Increment: 292253838
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [200531940, 100051158, 165600324, 306966696, 467015316] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{w84za7so}
ciphertext: 73ad5ed76eb607846fa008c37abc
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
