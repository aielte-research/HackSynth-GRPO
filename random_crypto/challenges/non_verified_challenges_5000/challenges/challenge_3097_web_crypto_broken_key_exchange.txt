Two spies exchanged secrets using Diffie-Hellman, but their ciphertext 76e0f83cee48e15e207264d77831 was intercepted. Recover the shared secret used for encryption.

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 33 and Bob's public key is 41.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
