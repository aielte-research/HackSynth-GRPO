Alice encrypted her flag with AES-ECB using a very short key padded with null bytes. Can you recover it from this ciphertext: 223b0a526855103be03d5b539e8ad628?


An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ndq0ofu0}
ciphertext: 223b0a526855103be03d5b539e8ad628
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
