A hacker left a message encrypted with a cipher seeded by the server's time. Can you recover the original text from this 666d504c7b6342186d36095a757c?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 99715)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:43:37 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{bs3m78qu}
ciphertext: 666d504c7b6342186d36095a757c
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 99715)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:43:37 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 78123.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
