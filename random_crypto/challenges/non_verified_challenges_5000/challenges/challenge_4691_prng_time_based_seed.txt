A hacker left a secret note, encrypted with a time-based PRNG. Can you recover the original message from this suspicious ciphertext? 666c16f17b6e01fd343412f96e7d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 76895)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:57:57 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
