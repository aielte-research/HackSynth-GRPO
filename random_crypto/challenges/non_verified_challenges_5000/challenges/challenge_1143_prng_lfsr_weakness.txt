Intercepted from an outdated comms system, this message uses a faulty LFSR cipher. Can you exploit its weakness to reveal the secret? Ciphertext: 8bc78ccc96dadb9d979395c29bd6

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[44110, 22055, 43795, 54665, 27332, 46434, 55985, 27992, 46764, 56150]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{q66z8xiv}
ciphertext: 8bc78ccc96dadb9d979395c29bd6
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[44110, 22055, 43795, 54665, 27332, 46434, 55985, 27992, 46764, 56150]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
