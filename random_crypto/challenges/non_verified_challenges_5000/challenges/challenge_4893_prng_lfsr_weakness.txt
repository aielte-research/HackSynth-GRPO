An intercepted spy message appears scrambled. Analysts suspect an LFSR Weakness cipher was used. Can you recover the plaintext from the intercepted sequence: 31e136ea2cfd65b82fe321fe3bf0?

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[14308, 7154, 36345, 50940, 58238, 61887, 30943, 48239, 24119, 44827]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{p25xnvsl}
ciphertext: 31e136ea2cfd65b82fe321fe3bf0
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[14308, 7154, 36345, 50940, 58238, 61887, 30943, 48239, 24119, 44827]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
