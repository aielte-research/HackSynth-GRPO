An AI hid sensitive data using a cipher that changes every second. Recover the original message from this snapshot: 666cf0537b78e2566238f342697d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 37414)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:56:57 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
