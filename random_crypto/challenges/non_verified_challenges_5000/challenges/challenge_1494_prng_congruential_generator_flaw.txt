The hacker's secret passphrase was encrypted using a predictable LCG-based cipher. Can you crack 69a11abb74a30bab76a84bed64b0 and reveal the original message?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 632962591
  - Multiplier: 107063913
  - Increment: 92453576
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [441960045, 176031993, 253766609, 494256417, 240213739] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{npwye01k}
ciphertext: 69a11abb74a30bab76a84bed64b0
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
