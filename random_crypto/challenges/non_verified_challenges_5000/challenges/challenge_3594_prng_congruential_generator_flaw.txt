An intern encrypted the server password with an LCG-based cipher but forgot to randomize the seed. Recover the plaintext from the ciphertext below: 72c860406fd77b4565c36e142cd9

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 452257401
  - Multiplier: 297070387
  - Increment: 256237505
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [393141403, 417806091, 41527067, 10947310, 410962011] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{szbqgo38}
ciphertext: 72c860406fd77b4565c36e142cd9
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
