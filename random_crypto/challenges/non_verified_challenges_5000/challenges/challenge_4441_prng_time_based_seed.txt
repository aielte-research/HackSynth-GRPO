A spy encoded their secret using a cipher seeded with the system clock. Can you recover the original message from this output? 666c70607b61706c336c74306b7d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 10206)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:52:10 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{aak3le7k}
ciphertext: 666c70607b61706c336c74306b7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 10206)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:52:10 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 4359.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
