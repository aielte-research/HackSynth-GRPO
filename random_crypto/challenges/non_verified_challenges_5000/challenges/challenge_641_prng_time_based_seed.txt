A mysterious log-in page returns 666c10e47b6207f7626f05e9727d as a response at midnight daily. Crack the PRNG-based encryption to discover its hidden secret before the timer resets!

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 46045)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:52:23 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{bvtbotjr}
ciphertext: 666c10e47b6207f7626f05e9727d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 46045)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:52:23 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 29059.
