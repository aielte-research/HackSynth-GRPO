Two agents agreed on a secret in public, but someone intercepted their Diffie-Hellman exchange. Can you recover the shared key to decrypt: ae5b05fbb573c646f2419d1ffa68?


The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 62 and Bob's public key is 50.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{044cyz39}
ciphertext: ae5b05fbb573c646f2419d1ffa68
cipher: Diffie-Hellman
hint: The prime used in this key exchange is small. You can recover the private key by brute-force.
