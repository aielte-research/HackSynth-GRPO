Intercepted last midnight: suspicious message encrypted by a time-dependent PRNG. Recover the original plaintext from 666c284c7b37214e39667949307d before the next timed drop!

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 48264)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:47:02 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7he9f0b0}
ciphertext: 666c284c7b37214e39667949307d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 48264)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:47:02 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 18731.
