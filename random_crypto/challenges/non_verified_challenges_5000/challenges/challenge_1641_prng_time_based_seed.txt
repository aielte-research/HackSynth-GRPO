The hacker left a message encrypted with their custom PRNG cipher, seeded by a timestamp. Can you recover it? Ciphertext: 666c223f7b702829356e25376b7d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 72379)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:46:17 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{pkq5nfok}
ciphertext: 666c223f7b702829356e25376b7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 72379)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:46:17 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 17240.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
