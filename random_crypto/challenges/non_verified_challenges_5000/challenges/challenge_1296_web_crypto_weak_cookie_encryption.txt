Agent lost his password, a tiny string, so the vault's AES-ECB key was padded with null bytes. Retrieve the flag from this 4ed4ee7c5ec26bd8881fcf1b83039726!

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{rldgivia}
ciphertext: 4ed4ee7c5ec26bd8881fcf1b83039726
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
