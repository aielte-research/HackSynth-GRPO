A whistleblower sends you secret coordinates, but the message is encrypted using the Autokey cipher. Can you recover them from this ciphertext? gp aipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{n1s1pdvu}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{u1f1ydir}
ciphertext: gp aipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{n1s1pdvu}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: ycw
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
