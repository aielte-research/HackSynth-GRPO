We found a message encrypted in AES-ECB, but the key looks suspiciously short. Can you recover the plaintext from this ciphertext? a6517bb2dcf5dfe3899a7939a4a6e3df

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qd1ioqat}
ciphertext: a6517bb2dcf5dfe3899a7939a4a6e3df
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
