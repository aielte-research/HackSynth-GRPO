A hacker hid the password to the vault using their homebrew 751fcef668449ee37f479be6200e cipher. Can you reveal the secrets by cracking this predictable algorithm?


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 407539744
  - Multiplier: 288335210
  - Increment: 353660807
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [296347101, 185490633, 223670273, 263951217, 270355313] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{71rl44w3}
ciphertext: 751fcef668449ee37f479be6200e
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
