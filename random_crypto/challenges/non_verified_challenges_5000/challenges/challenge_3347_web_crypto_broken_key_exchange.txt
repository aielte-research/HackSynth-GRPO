A hacker intercepted Alice and Bobâ€™s Diffie-Hellman exchange. They encrypted a secret with their shared key: 042701a2f7e9fa9f57c5f1004cab. Can you recover the key and decrypt the message?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 47 and Bob's public key is 15.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
