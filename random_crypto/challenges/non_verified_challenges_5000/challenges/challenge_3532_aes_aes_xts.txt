An old hard driveâ€™s sector was encrypted for secrecy, but you found the ciphertext: ciphertext1:57681c126c475bb07c3fb3f827a941de, ciphertext2: 4deed926d9b25618aa96fb9260733322a3b4d1e7a85bc2a116a02bbd37731389. Can you recover the original data using AES-XTS?

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{897mfv2x}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:57681c126c475bb07c3fb3f827a941de, ciphertext2: 4deed926d9b25618aa96fb9260733322a3b4d1e7a85bc2a116a02bbd37731389
cipher: AES-XTS
hint: AES-XTS with tweak reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The tweak used for both encryptions is: a3d879febdbe2fcd3426d1d34b951112
subtype: aes_xts
archetype: aes
