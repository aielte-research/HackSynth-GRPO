Intercepted spy notes show the enemy uses an evolving key. Can you decrypt their secret orders from the message below using the Autokey cipher? cb bipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{s1k6tahr}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{z1x6cauo}
ciphertext: cb bipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{s1k6tahr}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: uox
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
