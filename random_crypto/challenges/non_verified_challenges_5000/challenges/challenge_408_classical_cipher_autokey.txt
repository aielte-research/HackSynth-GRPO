An elusive hacker transmitted key instructions, encrypted with an Autokey cipher. Can you break the code and recover the message? Ciphertext: bz eipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{sfs6n2bv}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{zsb6n2os}
ciphertext: bz eipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{sfs6n2bv}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: tma
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
