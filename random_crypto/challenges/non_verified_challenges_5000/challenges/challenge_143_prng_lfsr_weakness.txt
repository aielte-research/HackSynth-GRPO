Agent Lark intercepted 72bb75b06fb222e07be56eb965aa, an urgent message encrypted with a flawed stream cipher. Can you exploit the LFSR weakness to recover the secret?

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[24271, 44903, 55219, 27609, 13804, 39670, 19835, 42685, 21342, 10671]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{e67o2znq}
ciphertext: 72bb75b06fb222e07be56eb965aa
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[24271, 44903, 55219, 27609, 13804, 39670, 19835, 42685, 21342, 10671]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
