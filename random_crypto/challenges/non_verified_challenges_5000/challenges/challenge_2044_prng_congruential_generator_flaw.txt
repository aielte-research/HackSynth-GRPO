Rumors say the vault's code is generated by a predictable pseudo-random method. Can you recover the key from this intercepted output? 5b940d2b46c95b275bcd5d3f0885

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1523191776
  - Multiplier: 685534005
  - Increment: 198625498
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [771776050, 824544820, 1396866814, 92433424, 171585898] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{17kf51s5}
ciphertext: 5b940d2b46c95b275bcd5d3f0885
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
