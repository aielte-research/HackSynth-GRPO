A hacker dumped banking data, encrypting accounts using a time-seeded PRNG. Can you recover the secrets from the captured ciphertext? Here it is: 666cd35f7b6ac7006132824a6d7d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 87176)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:42:24 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ju8a20rm}
ciphertext: 666cd35f7b6ac7006132824a6d7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
