Intercepted under radio static, this encrypted message uses an old stream cipher vulnerable to LFSR weaknesses. Can you recover the original text from 2ab82db337ad74ae38b07bba2ea9?

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[20988, 43262, 54399, 27199, 13599, 39567, 52551, 26275, 13137, 39336]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{y8ztd7nb}
ciphertext: 2ab82db337ad74ae38b07bba2ea9
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[20988, 43262, 54399, 27199, 13599, 39567, 52551, 26275, 13137, 39336]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
