Intercepted message details the vault entry code. However, spies encrypted it with an Autokey cipher. Can you decrypt fe xipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{0r8tj01s} to retrieve the code?


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{0y8gs01s}
ciphertext: fe xipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{0r8tj01s}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: xrt
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
