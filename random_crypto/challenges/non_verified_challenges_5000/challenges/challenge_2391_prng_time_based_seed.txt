A hacker hid a code in a message scrambled by a time-based PRNG cipher. Can you recover the original text from this 666cee317b65bc623767bc2c6c7d using your crypto skills?


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 96817)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:04:22 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
