Rumors say the hacker's passphrase is hidden in this encrypted clue, protected by an evolving key: se kdku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{7gpxodhy}. Can you decrypt the message and reveal the secret?

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
