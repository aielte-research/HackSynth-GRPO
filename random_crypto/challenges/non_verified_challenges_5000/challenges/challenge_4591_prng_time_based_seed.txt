An archivist encrypted the vault's password last midnight using a time-based PRNG. The ciphertext: 666c4cc27b655bcc74684bc6357d. Can you recover the original password with only this information?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 13786)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:55:52 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{evithfc5}
ciphertext: 666c4cc27b655bcc74684bc6357d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 13786)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:55:52 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 11685.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
