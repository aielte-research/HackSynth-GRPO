Intercepted hacker chats reveal a secret flag, but it's encrypted using a flawed stream cipher. Can you exploit the LFSR weakness to recover the flag from 007307781d7c02271726076b1062?


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[32292, 16146, 8073, 4036, 34786, 50161, 25080, 12540, 39038, 52287]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{cd8q9atv}
ciphertext: 007307781d7c02271726076b1062
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[32292, 16146, 8073, 4036, 34786, 50161, 25080, 12540, 39038, 52287]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
