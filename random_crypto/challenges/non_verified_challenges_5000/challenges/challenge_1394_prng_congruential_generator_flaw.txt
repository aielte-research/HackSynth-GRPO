The vaultâ€™s code was encrypted using a predictable LCG-based method. If you can break its sequence, the secret inside is yours: 5b234f3e4636483e5f22173f4732


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1189044831
  - Multiplier: 970795349
  - Increment: 915204198
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [14431864, 536973482, 227909263, 495843725, 688824850] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{yfgbm9fz}
ciphertext: 5b234f3e4636483e5f22173f4732
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
