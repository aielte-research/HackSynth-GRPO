An intercepted message, encrypted with a flawed LFSR system, hides the location of a rogue node. Decrypt ac21ab2ab179a720bd35f82bae30 to unveil the coordinates.

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[13680, 39608, 19804, 9902, 37719, 18859, 42197, 21098, 10549, 38042]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{4mmwx2fd}
ciphertext: ac21ab2ab179a720bd35f82bae30
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[13680, 39608, 19804, 9902, 37719, 18859, 42197, 21098, 10549, 38042]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
