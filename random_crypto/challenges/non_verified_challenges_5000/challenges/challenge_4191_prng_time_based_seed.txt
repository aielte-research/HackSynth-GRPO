Someone hid a secret in a message, encrypted with a time-based PRNG cipher. Can you recover the original plaintext from this ciphertext? 666d1fab7b7411fb656714b5337c

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 99552)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:46:26 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
