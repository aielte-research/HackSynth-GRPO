A rogue developer hid a wallet key behind a message, encrypted with an Autokey cipher. Decrypt dv rhku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{a058kwch} to uncover the key and claim the lost crypto.

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{i058rjlh}
ciphertext: dv rhku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{a058kwch}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: vinh
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
