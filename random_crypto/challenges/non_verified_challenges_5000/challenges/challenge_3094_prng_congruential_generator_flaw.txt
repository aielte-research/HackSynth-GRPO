A hacker stole secret coordinates using an LCG-based encryption. Recover the message from the intercepted ciphertext: 5afcfaa347a1f2ab51f8a9f50ced


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1923229946
  - Multiplier: 1505381543
  - Increment: 1394446552
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1879182198, 817222186, 1121042938, 1416562978, 1535081984] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1iomh210}
ciphertext: 5afcfaa347a1f2ab51f8a9f50ced
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
