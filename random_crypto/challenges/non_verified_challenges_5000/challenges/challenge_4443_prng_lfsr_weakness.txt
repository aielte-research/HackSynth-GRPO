An old security camera sent logs encrypted with a weak LFSR-based cipher. Intercept the message: 7d7c7a7760672e237a722c772a6d

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[17035, 8517, 4258, 34897, 50216, 25108, 45322, 55429, 27714, 13857]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{w53ab7g1}
ciphertext: 7d7c7a7760672e237a722c772a6d
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[17035, 8517, 4258, 34897, 50216, 25108, 45322, 55429, 27714, 13857]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
