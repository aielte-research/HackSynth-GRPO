A hacker intercepted this radio message encrypted with an LFSR-based scheme. Can you reveal the original text from the weak encryption?6bd26cd976c4798c34d76cda7ec3

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{zt29iads}
ciphertext: 6bd26cd976c4798c34d76cda7ec3
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[64040, 32020, 48778, 57157, 28578, 47057, 56296, 28148, 14074, 7037]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
