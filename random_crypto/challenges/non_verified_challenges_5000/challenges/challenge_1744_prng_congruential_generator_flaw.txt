A hacker used a homemade random number generator to encrypt their diary. Recover the secret by analyzing the predictable numbers. Ciphertext: 6730594a7a304d59646442556721


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1022867429
  - Multiplier: 553746185
  - Increment: 200203243
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [341166052, 24222343, 858611913, 387468685, 535250293] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{lute8zxf}
ciphertext: 6730594a7a304d59646442556721
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
