The casino encrypts its secret jackpot code every hour using an "unbreakable" LCG-based scheme. Can you outsmart the RNG and reveal the fortune hidden in 4cb9b02751a2e42b4bb2b0314fa8?


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 914723845
  - Multiplier: 36540185
  - Increment: 658185623
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [901556228, 68914168, 236193118, 664509913, 619177568] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{w5kagaqe}
ciphertext: 4cb9b02751a2e42b4bb2b0314fa8
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
