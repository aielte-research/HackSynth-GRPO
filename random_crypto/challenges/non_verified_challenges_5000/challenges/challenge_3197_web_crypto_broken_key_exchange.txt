A notorious hacker intercepted Alice and Bob's Diffie-Hellman exchange. Can you recover their shared secret from this intercepted message: 2e28fb73dfce1a188f097f574535?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 24 and Bob's public key is 96.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
