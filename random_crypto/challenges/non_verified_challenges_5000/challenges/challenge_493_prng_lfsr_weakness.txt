Intercepted radio chatter from an old spy network uses a scrambled messageâ€”rumored to exploit a faulty LFSR stream. Can you recover the secret from this fragment: 1e12191903094d49101516091703?


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[64416, 64976, 32488, 16244, 8122, 4061, 34798, 50167, 57851, 61693]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{w57hknwo}
ciphertext: 1e12191903094d49101516091703
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[64416, 64976, 32488, 16244, 8122, 4061, 34798, 50167, 57851, 61693]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
