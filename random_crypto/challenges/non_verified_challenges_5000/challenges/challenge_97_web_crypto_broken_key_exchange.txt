Agents Alice and Bob exchanged keys using Diffie-Hellman, but Eve intercepted their secret message: 85baa5b322eb61bc4bf5a4f9759f. Can you recover the original text?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 53 and Bob's public key is 35.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
