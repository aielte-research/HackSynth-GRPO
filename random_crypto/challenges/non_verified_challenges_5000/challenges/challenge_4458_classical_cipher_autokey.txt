A hacker intercepted a message hidden with the Autokey cipher. Can you decrypt the secret inside? Ciphertext: if dipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{jqfkzw8z}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qdokmt8l}
ciphertext: if dipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{jqfkzw8z}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: asz
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
