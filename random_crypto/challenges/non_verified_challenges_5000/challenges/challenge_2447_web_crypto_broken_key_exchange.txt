Two spies exchanged secret coordinates using Diffie-Hellman, but someone intercepted their message. Can you recover the shared secret from their conversation? 49a6550acd6f210633a9f710f24f

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 59 and Bob's public key is 97.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{99w1gwz5}
ciphertext: 49a6550acd6f210633a9f710f24f
