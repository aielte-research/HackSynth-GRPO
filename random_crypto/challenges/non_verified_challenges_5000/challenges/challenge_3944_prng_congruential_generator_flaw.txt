A rookie hacker encrypted secret keys with their homemade LCG-based cipher. Can you crack the 527cab2b4f65ae3a537dbb2e076d and expose the flaws before they return?


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1556344512
  - Multiplier: 140318241
  - Increment: 1060877329
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1106738647, 262000264, 1243075225, 146641162, 177761371] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{udvgmqb3}
ciphertext: 527cab2b4f65ae3a537dbb2e076d
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
