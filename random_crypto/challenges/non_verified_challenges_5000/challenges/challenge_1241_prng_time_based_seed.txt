An agent encrypted secret coordinates with a PRNG seeded by the time. Recover the plaintext from the intercepted message: 666c512d7b67473964675e2d717d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 65824)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:36:12 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{gwsdgngq}
ciphertext: 666c512d7b67473964675e2d717d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 65824)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:36:12 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 12362.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
