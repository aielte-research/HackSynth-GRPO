Someone intercepted the vault's OTP codes, encrypted with a faulty LCG-based cipher. Can you predict the next numbers and recover the secrets from: 2689a59c3bdcbe9d748cf2947298

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1647604335
  - Multiplier: 829111723
  - Increment: 205310378
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [718968829, 598710150, 466408373, 361125007, 1570526004] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{9zf4i6o2}
ciphertext: 2689a59c3bdcbe9d748cf2947298
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
