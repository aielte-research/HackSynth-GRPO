A hacker intercepted a secret message encoded with the Autokey cipher. Can you uncover the original text hidden in ez hqku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{13f0dkyt}?


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{13n0kxht}
ciphertext: ez hqku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{13f0dkyt}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: wmdq
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
