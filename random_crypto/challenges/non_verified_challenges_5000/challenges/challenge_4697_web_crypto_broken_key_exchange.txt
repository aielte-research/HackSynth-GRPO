Spies exchanged secrets using classic Diffie-Hellman, confident in its strength. But one agent wrote down c47434bd73fd274b6d501227ac25â€”can you uncover the shared secret and reveal the hidden message?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 59 and Bob's public key is 54.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
