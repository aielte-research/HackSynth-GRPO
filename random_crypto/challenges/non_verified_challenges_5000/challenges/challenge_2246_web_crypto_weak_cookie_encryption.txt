An intern encrypted secrets with AES-ECB, using a short password as key and padding it with null bytes. Can you recover the flag from d85a2eb50a684e3194bee376252bb750?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{sqci0wcs}
ciphertext: d85a2eb50a684e3194bee376252bb750
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
