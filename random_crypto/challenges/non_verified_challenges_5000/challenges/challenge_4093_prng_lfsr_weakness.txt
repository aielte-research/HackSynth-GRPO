A hacker intercepted a secret transmission secured by a flawed LFSR cipher. Can you recover the original message from the ciphertext below? f351f45aee51a257f859e65aa740

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{l7jmdsg2}
ciphertext: f351f45aee51a257f859e65aa740
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[63127, 31563, 15781, 40658, 20329, 42932, 21466, 43501, 21750, 10875]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
