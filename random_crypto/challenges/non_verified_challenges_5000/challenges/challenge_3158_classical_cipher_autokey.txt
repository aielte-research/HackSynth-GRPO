An intercepted message between rival hackers is encrypted with a shifting secret. Can you recover the original message from this Autokey cipher? Ciphertext: ph yjku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{dtcak5g0}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{lapjk5t0}
ciphertext: ph yjku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{dtcak5g0}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: huuj
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
