Intercepted messages between two spies rely on Diffie-Hellman to exchange a secret. Can you recover the shared key and reveal the flag? Ciphertext: 2c28bd724d757dc1638f67f90838

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 73 and Bob's public key is 10.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7yilgii1}
ciphertext: 2c28bd724d757dc1638f67f90838
cipher: Diffie-Hellman
hint: The prime used in this key exchange is small. You can recover the private key by brute-force.
necessary_info: The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
