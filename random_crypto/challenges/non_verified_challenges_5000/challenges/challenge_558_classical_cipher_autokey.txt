Intercepted from a suspected agent, this encrypted message uses an Autokey cipher. Can you reveal its hidden content? Ciphertext: oj sipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{umsgxlao}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{bzbgkimc}
ciphertext: oj sipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{umsgxlao}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: gwo
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
