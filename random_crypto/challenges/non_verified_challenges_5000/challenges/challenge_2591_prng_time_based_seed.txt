A hacker hid launch codes inside 666c19f07b751ba579714ca6747d, encrypted with a PRNG seeded by a secret timestamp. Recover the seed to reveal the original message.


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 97006)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:09:02 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{uc2yq41t}
ciphertext: 666c19f07b751ba579714ca6747d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 97006)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:09:02 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 30871.
