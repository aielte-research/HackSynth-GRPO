Intercepted data was encrypted with AES-ECB using a short key padded with null bytes. Recover the original message from this ciphertext: f5465026c7f06890ccbb69df183e0c83

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{kuvdyi24}
ciphertext: f5465026c7f06890ccbb69df183e0c83
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
