A rival hacker intercepted your secret message, encrypted with an LFSR-based stream cipher. Decrypt the message below and recover the original flag: 855c8257984a8a5a8c469343884d


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[49609, 24804, 12402, 38969, 52252, 26126, 13063, 6531, 36033, 50784]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{zijovpsk}
ciphertext: 855c8257984a8a5a8c469343884d
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[49609, 24804, 12402, 38969, 52252, 26126, 13063, 6531, 36033, 50784]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
