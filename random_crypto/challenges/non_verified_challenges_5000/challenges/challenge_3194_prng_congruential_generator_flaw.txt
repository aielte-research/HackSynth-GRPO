The hacker's messages, encrypted with a homebrewed LCG-based scheme, fell into your hands. Crack the code and reveal the secret: 2e6f340a336a30022d3a3215307e

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 2018142271
  - Multiplier: 591245216
  - Increment: 558590987
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1860921980, 1664940307, 1847446216, 1047659771, 84779422] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ieoe9gxx}
ciphertext: 2e6f340a336a30022d3a3215307e
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
