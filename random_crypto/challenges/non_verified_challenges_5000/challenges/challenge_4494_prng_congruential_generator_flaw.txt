Decrypt the intercepted message: Bob used a homemade stream cipher, seeding the LCG with his birthday. Can you recover the flag from 6271b0c57f2bbb94762bb2d77460?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 717530865
  - Multiplier: 506877631
  - Increment: 611164763
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [65525269, 466241757, 156941435, 34071673, 196914171] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{6j6r6cup}
ciphertext: 6271b0c57f2bbb94762bb2d77460
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
