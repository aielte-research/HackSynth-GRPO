Intercepted at midnight, this secret message was encrypted using a time-based PRNG. Can you recover the plaintext from the garbled output? Ciphertext: 666c7e187b347e1c727a6d1c707d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 37321)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:24:32 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
