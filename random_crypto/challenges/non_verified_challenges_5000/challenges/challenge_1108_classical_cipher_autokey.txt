An agent left a coded message for extraction. They mentioned it's encrypted with "a self-keying method from the 16th century." The ciphertext: ir sqku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{k4mftfz8}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{s4tscfm8}
ciphertext: ir sqku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{k4mftfz8}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: aeoq
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
