The hacker left a message encrypted with a PRNG seeded by the system clock. Can you recover the flag from 666cb2f07b63b2ee3439a9fe337d?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 71749)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:58:36 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
