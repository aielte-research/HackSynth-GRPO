A hacker left an encrypted message using their "unbreakable" LCG-based cipher. Can you predict the pseudorandom sequence and recover the original message from 7ab15de567ba5be475ac05ee6fa0?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1448504570
  - Multiplier: 143583912
  - Increment: 3387630
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [516798312, 771603534, 1254088748, 463593696, 61771542] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ggfiq9ls}
ciphertext: 7ab15de567ba5be475ac05ee6fa0
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
