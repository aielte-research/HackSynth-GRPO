An intercepted hacker message, suspected to use the Autokey cipher, could reveal their next move. Decrypt pa uipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{u50g1uny} to stop the cyberattack in time.

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{b50t1dnl}
ciphertext: pa uipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{u50g1uny}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: hnq
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
