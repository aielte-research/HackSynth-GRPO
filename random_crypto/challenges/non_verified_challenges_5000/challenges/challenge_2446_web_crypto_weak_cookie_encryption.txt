We encrypted a flag with AES-ECB, using a short key padded with null bytes. Can you reveal it? The ciphertext is: 3244a8cc8d5f8ad793771a04483d826a

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{627810e8}
ciphertext: 3244a8cc8d5f8ad793771a04483d826a
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
