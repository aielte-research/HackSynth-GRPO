Intercepted messages from the rogue AI are scrambled with LCG Predictability. Recover the original command hidden in the cipher: 2d23de12307ad2473b7d8e102832


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1510291274
  - Multiplier: 847929115
  - Increment: 513642435
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [840961834, 670108997, 252386348, 1505778597, 472111034] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{5m2p21ec}
ciphertext: 2d23de12307ad2473b7d8e102832
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
