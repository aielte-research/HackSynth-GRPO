A hacker set a secret message to encrypt with a time-dependent generator. Can you recover the plaintext from this apparently random string: 666c678f7b366e9037356bd0657d?


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 76716)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:25:40 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{6hx75m8e}
ciphertext: 666c678f7b366e9037356bd0657d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 76716)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:25:40 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 1768.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
