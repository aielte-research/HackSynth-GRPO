Can you recover the password? I encrypted it with AES-ECB using a one-byte key padded with nulls. Here is the ciphertext: 0abf0233acc7475d47f56c53278a3487

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{0lewqtr4}
ciphertext: 0abf0233acc7475d47f56c53278a3487
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
