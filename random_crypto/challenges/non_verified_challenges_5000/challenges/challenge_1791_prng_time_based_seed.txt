Prof. Chronos encrypted the lab exit code at midnight with a time-based PRNG. Recover the plaintext from this message: 666c34097b643a07626e3757757d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 68720)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:50:07 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{doibnb9u}
ciphertext: 666c34097b643a07626e3757757d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 68720)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:50:07 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 21870.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
