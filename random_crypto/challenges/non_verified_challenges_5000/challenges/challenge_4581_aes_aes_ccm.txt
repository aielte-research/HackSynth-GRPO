## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{spbvvoqx}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:14d372673417e11996e00c3fd28b, ciphertext2: 14d37267341ee34992a61a7dc48b
tag1: 25bd837ad71950bfabff13c8c5ef8f42
tag2: d2fede32db1510821a08746b6311aed8
cipher: AES
mode: CCM
hint: AES-CCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 44051fa7cb46adf6922343
subtype: aes_ccm
archetype: aes
