Intercepted during a covert transmission, this wd tzku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{zzikhoz8} hides the location of a hidden key. The Autokey cipher is suspected. Can you reveal the message?


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{hgvthbw8}
ciphertext: wd tzku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{zzikhoz8}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
