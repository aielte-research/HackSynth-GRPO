A hacker intercepted a secret Autokey-encrypted password from a rival group. Crack the code, hidden in vo erku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{e11obj3x}, to reveal their secret plans.


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{m11vos3x}
ciphertext: vo erku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{e11obj3x}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: nbar
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
