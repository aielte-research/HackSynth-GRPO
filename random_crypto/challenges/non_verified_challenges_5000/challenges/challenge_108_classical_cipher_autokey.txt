The hacker left a note encoded with the Autokey cipher. Can you uncover their secret word? Hereâ€™s the encrypted message: il ojku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{klnlgv1e}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ssaugi1b}
ciphertext: il ojku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{klnlgv1e}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: aykj
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
