An intruder left a secret message locked by a time-based PRNG cipher. Crack the code below and find their escape route: 666c3a827b646f90766e229c757d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 68862)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:55:02 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
