An old terminal spits out 666c79ea7b712ebc386670fe777d. Rumor has it the message was encrypted when the system's clock struck midnight. Can you decipher what was hidden by the timer?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 12417)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:19:33 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{q618fhsw}
ciphertext: 666c79ea7b712ebc386670fe777d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 12417)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:19:33 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 6285.
