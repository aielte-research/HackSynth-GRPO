Two spies exchanged a secret using Diffie-Hellman, but only this intercepted message remains: 04648e680c61a92261f98a7a58dc. Recover the shared key to reveal their plan.

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 72 and Bob's public key is 56.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1h35usq6}
ciphertext: 04648e680c61a92261f98a7a58dc
