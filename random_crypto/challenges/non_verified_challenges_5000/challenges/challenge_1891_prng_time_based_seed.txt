An old hacker hid his secret phrase in 666cc5db7b62cccd6579d4c8627d, encrypted using a PRNG seeded with a timestamp. Can you recover the message by unraveling the time-based cipher?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 54106)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:52:37 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{bhqeyptb}
ciphertext: 666cc5db7b62cccd6579d4c8627d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 54106)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:52:37 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 42172.
