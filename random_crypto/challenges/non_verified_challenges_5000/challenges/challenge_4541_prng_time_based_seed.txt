An intercepted spy message, encrypted using a PRNG seeded with the transmission time, needs decrypting. Can you unveil the secret behind 666c7c417b31641433716f4a757d?


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 12770)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:54:46 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1y23qrlu}
ciphertext: 666c7c417b31641433716f4a757d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 12770)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:54:46 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 7462.
