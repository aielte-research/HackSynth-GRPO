Someone intercepted a message encrypted with an LCG-based cipher. The cipher's predictability may let you recover the plaintext. Ciphertext: 59ac2d0e44a8220456f0755c08bd

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1137754041
  - Multiplier: 480345743
  - Increment: 22312457
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [382410808, 235606348, 349723003, 607964182, 784109134] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{hnmi0957}
ciphertext: 59ac2d0e44a8220456f0755c08bd
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
