A mysterious USB contains a file, encrypted with AES-XTS. Can you recover the original message from this ciphertext? ciphertext1:60fa8cf3bbf2a00c9b3cfcc3003a3fc7, ciphertext2: efc52cc4fbc72a9dc9b791e496923ec7ee59dffc09913fd3fae0abf0f17f00db

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{jf906jgv}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:60fa8cf3bbf2a00c9b3cfcc3003a3fc7, ciphertext2: efc52cc4fbc72a9dc9b791e496923ec7ee59dffc09913fd3fae0abf0f17f00db
cipher: AES-XTS
hint: AES-XTS with tweak reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The tweak used for both encryptions is: eb91f261f591cdb8f3f1f5968b64b47c
subtype: aes_xts
archetype: aes
