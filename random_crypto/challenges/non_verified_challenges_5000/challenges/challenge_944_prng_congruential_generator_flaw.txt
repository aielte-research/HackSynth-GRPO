Intercepted messages use a flawed random number generator. Can you predict its outputs and recover the secret from this 6da6c56370fb9c3d62ba926e6eb7?


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 585351164
  - Multiplier: 43197466
  - Increment: 344499984
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [34177018, 504070016, 115854924, 5497220, 472981820] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{189ip6je}
ciphertext: 6da6c56370fb9c3d62ba926e6eb7
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
