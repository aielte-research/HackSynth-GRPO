Two files were encrypted with AES-GCM, but the same nonce was reused. Both ciphertexts are here: ciphertext1:e752c0920f873c4eb0d1bbaea26a, ciphertext2: f556c88654de7f1eaac8bdbab337ec0f388b. Recover the secret message.

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{00ptvr4p}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:e752c0920f873c4eb0d1bbaea26a, ciphertext2: f556c88654de7f1eaac8bdbab337ec0f388b
tag1: a7b479add81b33d82260dd1fa757a0d9
tag2: a1076844ebb47b3b770f693093abc2ce
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 6b5fe954d899220dd21c9fdf
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
