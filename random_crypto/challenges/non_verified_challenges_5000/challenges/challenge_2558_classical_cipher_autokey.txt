The hacker left an encrypted note for their accomplice, using an Autokey cipher. Can you recover the original message? Ciphertext: tp igku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{lsvjrd3z}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{tzisrq3w}
ciphertext: tp igku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{lsvjrd3z}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: lceg
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
