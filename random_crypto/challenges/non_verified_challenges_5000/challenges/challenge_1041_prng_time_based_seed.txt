Intercepted at midnight, this message's key changed with time. Can you break the 666c73f87b6662e8373274a6617d using only the clue that the PRNG seed matches the Unix timestamp?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 52398)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:31:04 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
