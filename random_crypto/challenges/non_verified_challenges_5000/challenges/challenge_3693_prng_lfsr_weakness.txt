An old hacker encoded crucial evidence with an insecure LFSR cipher. Can you exploit its weakness to recover the message from this ciphertext? 8acc8dc797d5dd9687d9d5c783dd

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{u16ky9go}
ciphertext: 8acc8dc797d5dd9687d9d5c783dd
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[33545, 16772, 41154, 20577, 10288, 37912, 51724, 25862, 45699, 55617]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
