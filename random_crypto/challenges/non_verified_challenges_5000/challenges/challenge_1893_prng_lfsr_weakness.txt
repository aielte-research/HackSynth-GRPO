Intercepted radio signals from a rogue satellite use a weak LFSR-based encryption. Crack the message: 19011e0a041b48060c174b1f4d10

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[46965, 56250, 28125, 46830, 56183, 60859, 63197, 64366, 64951, 65243]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{v7ksz4r2}
ciphertext: 19011e0a041b48060c174b1f4d10
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[46965, 56250, 28125, 46830, 56183, 60859, 63197, 64366, 64951, 65243]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
