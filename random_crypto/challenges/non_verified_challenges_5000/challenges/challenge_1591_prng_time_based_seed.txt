A hacker intercepted a secret code, encrypted using a time-dependent PRNG. Can you rewind the clock and reveal the original message? Ciphertext: 666cade57b74abfa3075a5bb6d7d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 77358)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:45:05 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{tgx0ui9m}
ciphertext: 666cade57b74abfa3075a5bb6d7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 77358)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:45:05 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 52354.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
