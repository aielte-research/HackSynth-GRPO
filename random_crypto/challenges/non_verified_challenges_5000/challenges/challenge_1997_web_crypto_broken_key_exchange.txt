Spies exchanged a secret using Diffie-Hellman, but an eavesdropper intercepted 7c09033e7582f06321bd592b3d09. Can you compute the shared key and recover the original message?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 74 and Bob's public key is 74.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
