An agent hid the vault code using a time-seeded PRNG. Only the resulting 666cb0837b6aa2917677ab91647d remainsâ€”recover the message before the window of opportunity closes.

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 58595)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:02:08 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
