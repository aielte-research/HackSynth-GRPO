An agent sent you a secret, but forgot to include the exact time they encrypted it with their homebrew PRNG. Can you recover the message? Ciphertext: 666c5bc37b7a48ca6f7950c1307d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 36650)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:55:37 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{zrnoyje0}
ciphertext: 666c5bc37b7a48ca6f7950c1307d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 36650)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:55:37 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 15012.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
