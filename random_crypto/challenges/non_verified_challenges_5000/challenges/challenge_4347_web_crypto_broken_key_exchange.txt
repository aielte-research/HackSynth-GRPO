Intercepting Alice and Bob’s public keys, Eve captured their encrypted message below. Recover the shared secret to decrypt e34bc9f6994e66003e9447f94456 and reveal what they’re hiding.

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 77 and Bob's public key is 32.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
