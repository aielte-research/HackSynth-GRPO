A lazy admin used AES-ECB with short keys padded by null bytes. Now the encrypted flag, cdbde53b67c53573cbf3462cfd9d62a4, awaits you. Can you recover the original message?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ooartcml}
ciphertext: cdbde53b67c53573cbf3462cfd9d62a4
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
