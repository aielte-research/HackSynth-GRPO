A hacker left an encrypted note using an LCG-based stream cipher. Can you predict the sequence and reveal the secret message? Ciphertext: 72a74c006ff9445161be185475b6

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1770108597
  - Multiplier: 879131031
  - Increment: 1442773118
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [6730181, 511045439, 889379393, 1090284071, 1088297060] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{2i6uu53a}
ciphertext: 72a74c006ff9445161be185475b6
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
