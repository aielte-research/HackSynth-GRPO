My random number generator glitched, leaking my secret. Can you crack my encrypted message using its predictability? Ciphertext: 72abbbc16fafaf9e7ca4ebce22ba

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 2049908136
  - Multiplier: 1935495700
  - Increment: 1076274310
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1353461062, 663427478, 302873430, 1743578590, 1929918614] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{hu8hc1h6}
ciphertext: 72abbbc16fafaf9e7ca4ebce22ba
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
