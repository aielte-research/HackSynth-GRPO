An impatient hacker encrypted secret plans using a passphrase and the serverâ€™s current time. Crack the 666c67457b3137416c73304e6b7d before the time window disappears!

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 99767)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:45:43 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{11cls6lk}
ciphertext: 666c67457b3137416c73304e6b7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 99767)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:45:43 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 1570.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
