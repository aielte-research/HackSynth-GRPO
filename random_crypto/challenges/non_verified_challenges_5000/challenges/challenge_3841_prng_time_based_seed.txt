An encrypted distress call arrived, timestamp unknown. Recover the original message from this 666d60797b6733753735632e7a7c scrambled using a time-seeded PRNG cipher.

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 94421)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:38:30 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
