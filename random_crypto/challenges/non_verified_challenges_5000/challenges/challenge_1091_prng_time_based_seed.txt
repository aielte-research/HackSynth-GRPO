A hacker encrypted coordinates using a PRNG seeded with the timestamp at midnight. Can you recover the hidden location from this cipher? 666c4f137b75581633704f1b6c7d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 21307)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:32:27 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{uvb3paol}
ciphertext: 666c4f137b75581633704f1b6c7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 21307)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:32:27 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 11892.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
