Intercepted chat logs were encrypted with a weak pseudo-random key generator. Crack the code to reveal the message: 602444527d321240687d12426235

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 380699822
  - Multiplier: 324909135
  - Increment: 353539435
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [10555864, 89646081, 28129782, 305320011, 224179134] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{z7un57wd}
ciphertext: 602444527d321240687d12426235
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
