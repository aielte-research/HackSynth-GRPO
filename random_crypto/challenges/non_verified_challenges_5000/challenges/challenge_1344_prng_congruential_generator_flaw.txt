The vault's password was scrambled using a flawed LCG-based cipher. Can you predict the sequence and recover the original message from this ciphertext: 787fa532657bf2657227f0367d6e?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1115470793
  - Multiplier: 126841695
  - Increment: 813751137
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [293240458, 514744837, 523679783, 316011288, 433245201] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{h60l44cc}
ciphertext: 787fa532657bf2657227f0367d6e
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
