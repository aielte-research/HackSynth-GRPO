An old serverâ€™s logs were encrypted nightly using a time-seeded PRNG. Recover yesterday's admin note from this snippet: 666c5a987b67569766635a9e747d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 30918)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:59:44 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{gmhfcaat}
ciphertext: 666c5a987b67569766635a9e747d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 30918)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 11:59:44 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 15359.
