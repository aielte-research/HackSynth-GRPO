An engineer secured the lab’s door with a 666c04397b30506c79340e3f747d cipher, generated using the server’s clock. Can you decipher the entry code before time runs out?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 93180)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:53:19 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{052y4kat}
ciphertext: 666c04397b30506c79340e3f747d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 93180)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:53:19 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 25950.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
