Intercepted files use AES-ECB mode. We believe weak, short keys padded with null bytes are used. Can you recover the secret from this ciphertext: 9801360da33c2893e2596503b77fb0e5?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{q5rrhuz1}
ciphertext: 9801360da33c2893e2596503b77fb0e5
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
