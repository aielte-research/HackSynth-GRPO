An intern accidentally encrypted two secret messages with AES-GCM using the same nonce. Both ciphertexts were leaked. Can you exploit this mistake and recover the hidden flag from ciphertext1:c9a4ade5dc59ef2b47fbf50eb920, ciphertext2: dba0a5f18741ec7e1ff0f91eaa7d344c9eb7?

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qpu6dx0r}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:c9a4ade5dc59ef2b47fbf50eb920, ciphertext2: dba0a5f18741ec7e1ff0f91eaa7d344c9eb7
tag1: 762418ecbd8b227ade486a473df8912e
tag2: 13d3d0437e1d09c82a67f76cfac80da7
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: ff9d14070b6641bee693bcf9
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
