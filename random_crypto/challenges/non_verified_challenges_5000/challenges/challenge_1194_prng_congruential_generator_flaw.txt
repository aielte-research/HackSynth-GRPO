An impatient hacker left their random seed exposed while encrypting the flag with an LCG-based cipher. Can you predict the next values to recover the message? 66d672a27b836ab4338f7bbf76c7


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 18663536
  - Multiplier: 12709070
  - Increment: 15807103
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [15362587, 13438153, 8417725, 12068357, 17633333] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{9yq35hzv}
ciphertext: 66d672a27b836ab4338f7bbf76c7
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
