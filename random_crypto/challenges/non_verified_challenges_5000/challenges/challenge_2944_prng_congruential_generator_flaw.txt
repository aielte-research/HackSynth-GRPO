The casino's slot machine uses an LCG to encrypt jackpot codes. Can you predict the next win by cracking this sequence: 6e7e39777367332369756c7a3c6f?


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 920886920
  - Multiplier: 582374286
  - Increment: 643288792
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [28578120, 274071792, 400701944, 740755416, 668138128] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{uk3ag4j4}
ciphertext: 6e7e39777367332369756c7a3c6f
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
