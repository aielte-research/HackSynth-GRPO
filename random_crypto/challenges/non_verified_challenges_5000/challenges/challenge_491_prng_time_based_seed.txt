Someone scheduled a secret in the blockchain, encrypting it with a time-locked PRNG. Can you decrypt it? Ciphertext: 666c6f007b3738046a713a106b7d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 42865)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:49:13 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{76cjq4wk}
ciphertext: 666c6f007b3738046a713a106b7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 42865)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 13:49:13 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 3687.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
