An intercepted spy message was encrypted using a flawed LFSR-based stream cipher. Can you exploit its weakness and recover the original text from 3e0f390423552d5637113d0f211e?

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[36658, 51097, 25548, 12774, 6387, 3193, 34364, 49950, 24975, 45255]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{6u5orely}
ciphertext: 3e0f390423552d5637113d0f211e
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[36658, 51097, 25548, 12774, 6387, 3193, 34364, 49950, 24975, 45255]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
