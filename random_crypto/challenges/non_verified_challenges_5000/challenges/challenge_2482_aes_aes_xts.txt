An encrypted disk sector contains the code. Only AES-XTS can unlock its hidden message: ciphertext1:649d4f09618b242d4b101984b43d4549, ciphertext2: 827cde92c4531f5274d92f7223a0902b7525f1835506b3fc367bc36f91c8d531


The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{5715ygn5}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:649d4f09618b242d4b101984b43d4549, ciphertext2: 827cde92c4531f5274d92f7223a0902b7525f1835506b3fc367bc36f91c8d531
cipher: AES-XTS
hint: AES-XTS with tweak reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The tweak used for both encryptions is: 9cd57e295abe3cc08fa1ccd664e1e957
subtype: aes_xts
archetype: aes
