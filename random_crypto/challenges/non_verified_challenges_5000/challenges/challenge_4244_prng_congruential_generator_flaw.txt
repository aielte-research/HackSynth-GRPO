The vault's lock resets with each opening, but its passcode is always masked by this sequence: 2ab50ef737a00ef579ed5fa035a4. Can you spot the pattern and predict the next code?

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1468309226
  - Multiplier: 1261611383
  - Increment: 722257992
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1337893740, 858983476, 1262508966, 273025290, 483051652] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{yae5400y}
ciphertext: 2ab50ef737a00ef579ed5fa035a4
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
