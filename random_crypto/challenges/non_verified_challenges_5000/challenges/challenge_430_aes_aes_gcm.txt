Two messages were accidentally encrypted with the same AES-GCM nonce. Can you exploit this flaw to reveal the hidden flag? Ciphertext: ciphertext1:729f55fa40f73e49485cfb98aa77, ciphertext2: 609b5dee1be82a1f4b40eadeb82a212f0eb7

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{vgvmsefs}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:729f55fa40f73e49485cfb98aa77, ciphertext2: 609b5dee1be82a1f4b40eadeb82a212f0eb7
tag1: 207af546db81a7dc67065a8fec75b79b
tag2: cf20d524ea3bd4c67cd7a951c61633cd
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: f26f42b2d088e836ad344c8b
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
