Our intern used AES-ECB and set a tiny password, padded with nulls. Can you recover the secret from ad6b54bfaecb88c9800d50fb72c1777a?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{8cgl469v}
ciphertext: ad6b54bfaecb88c9800d50fb72c1777a
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
