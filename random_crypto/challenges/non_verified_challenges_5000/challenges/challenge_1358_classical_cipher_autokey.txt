A hacker left a message encrypted with the Autokey cipher. All we found is: pm qeku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{nz2y59ci}. Can you recover the plain text they hid?


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{vg2l59li}
ciphertext: pm qeku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{nz2y59ci}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}

The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: hzme
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
