A spy dropped an encrypted message at a caf√©. We intercepted fecfca1b4f63e7664d0c56c6dbe9, but the secret key is missing. Use the Diffie-Hellman method to recover the original message.

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 16 and Bob's public key is 29.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{mmeswap4}
ciphertext: fecfca1b4f63e7664d0c56c6dbe9
cipher: Diffie-Hellman
hint: The prime used in this key exchange is small. You can recover the private key by brute-force.
necessary_info: The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
