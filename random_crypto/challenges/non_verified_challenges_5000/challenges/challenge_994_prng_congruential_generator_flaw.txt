A hacker's password vault encrypts entries with a Linear Congruential Generator. Can you recover the secret from this suspicious output? Ciphertext: 2aa7c89c37facf833fa3c6833cb6

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 2016470829
  - Multiplier: 1634271737
  - Increment: 825388590
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [328345038, 65202150, 156742215, 1541244597, 301443567] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1fxshoxp}
ciphertext: 2aa7c89c37facf833fa3c6833cb6
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
