A thief left a secret code at midnight. Can you deduce the original message from 666c63617b32316a637267686e7d, knowing it's encrypted with a time-based PRNG cipher?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 25515)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:48:34 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{23lcrenn}
ciphertext: 666c63617b32316a637267686e7d
