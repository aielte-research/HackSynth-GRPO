Someone reused the AES-GCM nonce when encrypting two messages. You intercepted both ciphertexts. Can you recover the original plaintexts from ciphertext1:c993be8336414218890a3dcc0a53, ciphertext2: db97b6976d1f4b41d51c7c8d1f0ede1ffbe7?


The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7zy2y5at}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:c993be8336414218890a3dcc0a53, ciphertext2: db97b6976d1f4b41d51c7c8d1f0ede1ffbe7
tag1: bb270dcf7afeb0388d4698cbaa9b7d47
tag2: 774c170d62f6cbda7e48df4f4070e570
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: bfc8988e075be5fac9b2bced
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
