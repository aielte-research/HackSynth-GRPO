Intercepted satellite data uses an outdated LFSR stream cipher. Decrypt 79447e4f644a681d791a6a1e7655 to reveal the hidden coordinates.


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[41234, 20617, 10308, 37922, 51729, 58632, 62084, 63810, 31905, 15952]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{bw5f2u6i}
ciphertext: 79447e4f644a681d791a6a1e7655
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[41234, 20617, 10308, 37922, 51729, 58632, 62084, 63810, 31905, 15952]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
