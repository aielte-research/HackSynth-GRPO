An intercepted message encrypted with LFSR-based stream cipher leaked from an insecure IoT device. Can you recover the original plaintext from this weak implementation? 58825f89458f55d95bd90cdf5593

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ak7e721k}
ciphertext: 58825f89458f55d95bd90cdf5593
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[47152, 56344, 60940, 30470, 48003, 56769, 61152, 63344, 64440, 32220]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
