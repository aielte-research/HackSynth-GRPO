Intercepted message from Agent Shift sequenced via LFSR; analyst notes weak key scheduling. Decrypt "7a647d6f676778612867656c2475" to reveal the rendezvous location.


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[8476, 4238, 2119, 1059, 529, 33032, 49284, 57410, 28705, 14352]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{odi4oyd8}
ciphertext: 7a647d6f676778612867656c2475
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[8476, 4238, 2119, 1059, 529, 33032, 49284, 57410, 28705, 14352]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
