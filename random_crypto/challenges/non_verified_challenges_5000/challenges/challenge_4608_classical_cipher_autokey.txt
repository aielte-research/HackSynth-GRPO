A spy intercepted a message labeled "Autokey." Your mission: recover the hidden code from the ciphertext below and foil the plot. Ciphertext: op mcku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{wv3az2v4}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ec3ni2v4}
ciphertext: op mcku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{wv3az2v4}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: gcic
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
