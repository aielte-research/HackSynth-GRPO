An intercepted message uses an old LFSR-based scheme. Analysts suspect a weakness in its keystream. Recover the plaintext from this ciphertext: 99319e3a8435896acc3f9a25ca20

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[30581, 48058, 24029, 44782, 55159, 60347, 62941, 64238, 64887, 65211]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{hv73bex5}
ciphertext: 99319e3a8435896acc3f9a25ca20
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[30581, 48058, 24029, 44782, 55159, 60347, 62941, 64238, 64887, 65211]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
