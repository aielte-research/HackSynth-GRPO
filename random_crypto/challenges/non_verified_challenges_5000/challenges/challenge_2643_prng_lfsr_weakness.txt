A rogue satellite broadcasted secret coordinates encrypted with an LFSR-based cipher. Can you recover the message from this intercepted transmission? Ciphertext: 53bb54b04eef03b601b54de54faa

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[24183, 44859, 55197, 60366, 30183, 47859, 23929, 44732, 55134, 27567]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{86a4bx2z}
ciphertext: 53bb54b04eef03b601b54de54faa
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[24183, 44859, 55197, 60366, 30183, 47859, 23929, 44732, 55134, 27567]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
