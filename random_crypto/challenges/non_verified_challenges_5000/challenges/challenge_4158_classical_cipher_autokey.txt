A rogue AI secured its master password using the Autokey cipher. Can you decrypt its note and recover the secret? Ciphertext: pg gipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{8nv11x9u}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{8ui11g9u}
ciphertext: pg gipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{8nv11x9u}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: htc
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
