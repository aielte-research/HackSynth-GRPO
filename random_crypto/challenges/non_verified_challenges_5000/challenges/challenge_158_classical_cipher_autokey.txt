An agent intercepted a message, but the sender used an Autokey cipher. Can you uncover the secret by decrypting this text? Ciphertext: oh giku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{1cub0su3}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1kbo0bu3}
ciphertext: oh giku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{1cub0su3}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: guci
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
