An old hacker hid a password using a PRNG seeded with the fileâ€™s creation time. Can you recover the secret from this 666d5d6e7b65466836640c6a387c?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 89168)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:15:53 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{dza6e0c8}
ciphertext: 666d5d6e7b65466836640c6a387c
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 89168)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:15:53 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 80905.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
