Agent Nix encrypted the plans with a PRNG seeded at midnight. Recover the key to decrypt this message: 666cc7817b62d2d06a38c19e687d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 78687)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:45:18 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{bt6j8gxh}
ciphertext: 666cc7817b62d2d06a38c19e687d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 78687)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:45:18 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 42726.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
