Two messages were encrypted with AES-GCM but reused the same nonce. Can you recover the original plaintexts? The intercepted ciphertexts are: ciphertext1:4d4c674f94a82497d352a4281abb, ciphertext2: 5f486f5bcff63ddbda44b9600be62dbf2e11

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7jlgyihp}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:4d4c674f94a82497d352a4281abb, ciphertext2: 5f486f5bcff63ddbda44b9600be62dbf2e11
tag1: 730cb8c7a219042baec51cf1b0c86a0b
tag2: 8634ec935c7805d357b8474e547af7fe
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 6a886a8790bdaa156bcb0611
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
