A hacker intercepted Alice and Bobâ€™s Diffie-Hellman exchange and captured this encrypted message: 2e28fb73df9c0841dd1f2e5d4c35. Recover the shared secret to decrypt it.

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 52 and Bob's public key is 89.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
