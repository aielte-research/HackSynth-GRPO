Intercepted from a secret society, this Autokey-encrypted message, no dipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{af0sk1j1}, hides the passphrase needed to access their hidden fund. Can you reveal it?

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
