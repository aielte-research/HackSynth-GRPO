An agent intercepted a message labeled "AUTOKEY PROTOCOL." Can you decrypt the contents below, encrypted with an Autokey cipher? op xipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{01ddpsyr}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{01kqyslo}
ciphertext: op xipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{01ddpsyr}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: gct
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
