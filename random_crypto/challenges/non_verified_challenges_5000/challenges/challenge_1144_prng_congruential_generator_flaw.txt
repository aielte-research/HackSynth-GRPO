An intern encrypted the launch codes using a simple LCG-based cipher. Can you reveal the secret by breaking their predictable scheme? Ciphertext: 4508cba4580ec0ad175dcef44d19

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1555505960
  - Multiplier: 1284464985
  - Increment: 851494305
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [229757310, 677347695, 990181680, 111503225, 439255490] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{jjn49d7n}
ciphertext: 4508cba4580ec0ad175dcef44d19
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
