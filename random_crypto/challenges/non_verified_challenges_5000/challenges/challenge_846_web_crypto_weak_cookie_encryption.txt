The admin encrypted the flag with your short password using AES-ECB, carelessly padding the key with null bytes. Can you recover the flag from fbe8052db1491afbc76cc5c3acc05597?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{fsx82ui0}
ciphertext: fbe8052db1491afbc76cc5c3acc05597
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
