An agent intercepted a secret transmission, encoded using a cipher seeded by the senderâ€™s system time. Can you recover the original message from this encrypted text? 666c362b7b31657a6c363e23737d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 73320)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:22:07 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
