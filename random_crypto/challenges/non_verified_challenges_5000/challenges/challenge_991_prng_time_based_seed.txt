The hacker left a message, encrypted at midnight using their secret time-based PRNG cipher. Can you recover the original text from this ciphertext? 666ca1247b75b62b6e79b027747d


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 51222)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 14:00:06 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{uvhnypdt}
ciphertext: 666ca1247b75b62b6e79b027747d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 51222)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-17 14:00:06 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 49219.
