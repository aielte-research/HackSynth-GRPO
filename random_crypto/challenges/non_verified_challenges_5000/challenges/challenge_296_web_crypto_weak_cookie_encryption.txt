Intercepted a secret message, encrypted with AES-ECB. Rumor says they used a 2-byte key padded with nulls. Can you recover the plaintext? Ciphertext: f2afa3df7585590446c2c8e839522512

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{h8b11o7w}
ciphertext: f2afa3df7585590446c2c8e839522512
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
