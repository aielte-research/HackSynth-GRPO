An impatient hacker sends you a message: "I thought my random generator was clever. Bet you can't predict my next move!" The encrypted answer is: 56c059a64b9d5da805ca5fad53d1

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 2030140126
  - Multiplier: 709499991
  - Increment: 1838841715
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [1956204886, 297909003, 1378370228, 1418047091, 316288924] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1ei5fglc}
ciphertext: 56c059a64b9d5da805ca5fad53d1
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
