A careless intern encrypted a secret with AES-ECB, using a short password padded with nulls as the key. The ciphertext is: d5e0dd84d91dbdd17b8d237537bee392

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{j536sn5l}
ciphertext: d5e0dd84d91dbdd17b8d237537bee392
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
