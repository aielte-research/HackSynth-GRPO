While monitoring encrypted radio signals, you intercept this message. Rumor says the sender used a time-seeded PRNG to encrypt it. Ciphertext: 666c3ada7b30688e6d352a8a397d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 87505)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:47:28 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{033m5q79}
ciphertext: 666c3ada7b30688e6d352a8a397d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 87505)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:47:28 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 23485.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
