Intercepted spy traffic uses a weak stream cipher. Recover the original message from c374c47fde69dc74d17dd12bd565 and expose the vulnerabilities of their LFSR-based encryption.


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[25045, 12522, 6261, 35898, 17949, 41742, 20871, 10435, 37985, 18992]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{qyltet3p}
ciphertext: c374c47fde69dc74d17dd12bd565
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[25045, 12522, 6261, 35898, 17949, 41742, 20871, 10435, 37985, 18992]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
