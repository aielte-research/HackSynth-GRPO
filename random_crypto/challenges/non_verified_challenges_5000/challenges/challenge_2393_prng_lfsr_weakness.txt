Intercepted satellite data was encrypted with a flawed LFSR stream cipher. Can you recover the hidden message from the ciphertext below? e3b7e4bcfeade6aee7b6f2b6e8a6

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{vcubmwmm}
ciphertext: e3b7e4bcfeade6aee7b6f2b6e8a6
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[28499, 47017, 56276, 60906, 30453, 47994, 23997, 11998, 5999, 2999]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
