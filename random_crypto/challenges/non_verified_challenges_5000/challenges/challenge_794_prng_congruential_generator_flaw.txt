A hacker sent you an encoded message using a predictable LCG-based cipher. Can you break the sequence and reveal the secret? The ciphertext: 6665d6c07b6ccfc264398fd47274

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 65895168
  - Multiplier: 30749769
  - Increment: 50477756
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [22662275, 51285527, 39991883, 54192671, 2581139] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{exed08sr}
ciphertext: 6665d6c07b6ccfc264398fd47274
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
