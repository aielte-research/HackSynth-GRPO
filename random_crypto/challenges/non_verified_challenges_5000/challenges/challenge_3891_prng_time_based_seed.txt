An encrypted note was sent, but the key changes every second. Can you recover the message from this time-based PRNG cipher? Ciphertext: 666c7f097b74740232697405757d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 22117)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:39:36 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
