Intercepted during a high-stakes hackathon, this message uses a flawed stream cipher. Can you exploit the LFSR weakness and reveal the secret? Ciphertext: f1d9f6d2ecddfed2e6d7e6d0f5c8


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{higqbqeb}
ciphertext: f1d9f6d2ecddfed2e6d7e6d0f5c8
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[55268, 27634, 46585, 56060, 60798, 63167, 31583, 48559, 24279, 12139]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
