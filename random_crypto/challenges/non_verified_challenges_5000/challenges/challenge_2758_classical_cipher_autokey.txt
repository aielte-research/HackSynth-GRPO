A hacker encoded the password using the Autokey cipher before vanishing. The encrypted message is: cw jkku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{htrcbjre}. Can you recover the password?


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

flag: flag{paelbwoq}
ciphertext: cw jkku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{htrcbjre}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
