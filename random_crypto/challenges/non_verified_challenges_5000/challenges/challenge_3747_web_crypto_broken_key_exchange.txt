Agents exchanged secrets using Diffie-Hellman, but intercepted message 4e34bdb67e495fcc4804270a111a remains undeciphered. Recover their shared key to reveal the hidden directive.

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 42 and Bob's public key is 55.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
