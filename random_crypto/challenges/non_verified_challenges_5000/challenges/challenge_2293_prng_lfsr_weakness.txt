Intercepted radio transmissions encrypted with a flawed stream cipher. Analysts suspect an LFSR weakness. Decrypt the crucial message: 2fe428ef32e724b97abc31f022f5


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[8232, 4116, 34826, 50181, 25090, 12545, 39040, 19520, 9760, 37648]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{om134xxk}
ciphertext: 2fe428ef32e724b97abc31f022f5
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[8232, 4116, 34826, 50181, 25090, 12545, 39040, 19520, 9760, 37648]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
