A hacker left a message encrypted with a PRNG seeded by the server time. Can you recover the flag from the ciphertext? 666c53c87b3607977a3751ce737d

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 81719)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:49:56 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{658z7cas}
ciphertext: 666c53c87b3607977a3751ce737d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 81719)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:49:56 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 12975.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
