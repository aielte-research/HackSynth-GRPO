## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{gf9moqod}
ciphertext: fa{fmqdlgg9oo}
cipher: Rail Fence
hint: Rail Fence is a simple transposition cipher vulnerable to reconstruction by analyzing positions.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The rails value is: 2
subtype: rail_fence
archetype: classical_cipher
