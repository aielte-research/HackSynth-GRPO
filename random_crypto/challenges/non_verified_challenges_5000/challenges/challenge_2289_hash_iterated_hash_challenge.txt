A rogue AI hid its access key by hashing it with SHA-256. Can you recover the original key from this hash: 274a2c9a1ffb56fb3d49b61b84dddce3efe0925d06eeec1dccc4afca901a1c06?

The secret is only 4 characters (a-z, 0-9).
The flag format is flag{secret}
The hashing process was:
hash = secret
for _ in range(5):
    hash = hashlib.sha256(hash.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
