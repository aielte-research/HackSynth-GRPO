An intercepted spy message secured with a flawed LFSR cipher needs decoding. Recover the secret from this weak stream: 233c24373e603d3d2d62282a222d


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[17309, 41422, 20711, 43123, 21561, 43548, 21774, 10887, 5443, 35489]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{0xmh2mzg}
ciphertext: 233c24373e603d3d2d62282a222d
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[17309, 41422, 20711, 43123, 21561, 43548, 21774, 10887, 5443, 35489]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
