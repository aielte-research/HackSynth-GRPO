Intercepted at midnight, the spy's message appears random. Can you recover the plaintext from the 666c66707b62307b7a737078667d encrypted using a time-based PRNG cipher?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 19673)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:11:25 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
