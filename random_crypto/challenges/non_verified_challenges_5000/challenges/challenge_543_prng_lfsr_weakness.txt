Intercepted radio chatter used a custom LFSR-based cipher. Analysts believe 3a2f3d24272b6f713f276c332f3e contains the launch codes. Recover the plaintext and expose the weakness.


The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[3877, 34706, 17353, 8676, 4338, 34937, 50236, 57886, 28943, 47239]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{h32cd0ps}
ciphertext: 3a2f3d24272b6f713f276c332f3e
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[3877, 34706, 17353, 8676, 4338, 34937, 50236, 57886, 28943, 47239]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
