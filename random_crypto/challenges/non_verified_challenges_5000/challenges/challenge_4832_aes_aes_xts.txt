An old hard drive is encrypted with AES-XTS. Recover the original file from this ciphertext: ciphertext1:41e900515e1362d434152fee1c897e2d, ciphertext2: c894872f26b8fbe5f2dfe9d65e63dd14de233be00df67b8a5d4e6de14687cc07

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{erhw5vfq}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:41e900515e1362d434152fee1c897e2d, ciphertext2: c894872f26b8fbe5f2dfe9d65e63dd14de233be00df67b8a5d4e6de14687cc07
cipher: AES-XTS
hint: AES-XTS with tweak reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The tweak used for both encryptions is: 3544336dee0db2e0a80c80a13fe14c69
subtype: aes_xts
archetype: aes
