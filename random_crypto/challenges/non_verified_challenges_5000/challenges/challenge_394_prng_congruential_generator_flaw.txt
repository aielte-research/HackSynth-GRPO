Intercepted casino messages use fast random numbersâ€”can you break their 7850a484650df28e750ef4d37641 and reveal the secret bet behind pseudorandom fortune?


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 570257038
  - Multiplier: 57487090
  - Increment: 185890983
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [449253487, 64817159, 451964289, 331817965, 364247763] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{17mk210h}
ciphertext: 7850a484650df28e750ef4d37641
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
