Intercepted spy message! We believe it's encoded with an Autokey cipher, but the key is missing. Can you decrypt the secret orders? Ciphertext: zq iipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{bfk6bt4s}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ist6bg4p}
ciphertext: zq iipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{bfk6bt4s}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: rde
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
