A mysterious hacker left this encrypted note: uy qipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{a7sxqt2g}. Rumor says an evolving key hides the true message. Can you recover the secret using the Autokey cipher?


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{h7fgqg2d}
ciphertext: uy qipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{a7sxqt2g}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: mlm
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
