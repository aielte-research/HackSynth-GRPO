Help! I encrypted my secret with AES-ECB, but my key was too short—so I padded it with null bytes. Here’s the ciphertext: 91acac3cb14c31e40437cfe2ef7a6c80.

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ao9r6uvl}
ciphertext: 91acac3cb14c31e40437cfe2ef7a6c80
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
