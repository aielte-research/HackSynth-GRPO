An apprentice padded a short key with nulls before encrypting secrets with AES-ECB. Recover the flag from: b685597f03e3e06e470a1a0e366abdf8


An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ofb9qu9d}
ciphertext: b685597f03e3e06e470a1a0e366abdf8
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
