Alice encrypted two secrets for Bob using AES-GCM, but accidentally used the same nonce for both. Here is one of the ciphertexts: ciphertext1:556aa40c92c4bc09e58707e698eb, ciphertext2: 476eac18c99efe4efd801ba8cbb6adbe688a


The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{31gvhhn2}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:556aa40c92c4bc09e58707e698eb, ciphertext2: 476eac18c99efe4efd801ba8cbb6adbe688a
tag1: 3e13a5b6aa7a1711a00c881fdd574563
tag2: b0596a80dec72ea27f958ab866f54be2
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: b16abb1cb6887b9cb93047c1
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
