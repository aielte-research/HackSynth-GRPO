A mysterious hacker left a clue secured with the Autokey cipher. Can you uncover the secret key to reveal their intended message? Ciphertext: xh rlku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{6qbr269j}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{6yie269s}
ciphertext: xh rlku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{6qbr269j}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: punl
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
