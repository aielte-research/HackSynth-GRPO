An intern encrypted a flag using AES-ECB with a short key, padded with null bytes. The ciphertext is: 79cb5e3e40f8c69d65a0dd25e3501339

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{nwkbmlna}
ciphertext: 79cb5e3e40f8c69d65a0dd25e3501339
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
