Our trading bot sent an encrypted trade using a time-based PRNG. We intercepted 666ca1ac7b30b0a33864a5ac317d, but forgot the exact second. Can you recover the trade's secret?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 61337)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:12:37 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{0ph8deg1}
ciphertext: 666ca1ac7b30b0a33864a5ac317d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 61337)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:12:37 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 49355.
