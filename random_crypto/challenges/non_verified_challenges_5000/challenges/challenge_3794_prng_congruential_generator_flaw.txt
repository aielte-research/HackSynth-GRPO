A hacker claims their random number-based cipher is unbreakable. Prove them wrong: hereâ€™s an encrypted message with their LCG Predictability cipher: 73e016246eea19252cea452f20f1

The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1868867866
  - Multiplier: 1394529644
  - Increment: 1316417595
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [58193611, 447314255, 1240887759, 1198985031, 967923681] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{fnf9f2l5}
ciphertext: 73e016246eea19252cea452f20f1
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
