A hacker intercepted our secret meeting location, encrypted with an Autokey cipher. Can you decrypt the message and discover where weâ€™re meeting? Ciphertext: uy vipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{7y0u34nv}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7f0h34wv}
ciphertext: uy vipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{7y0u34nv}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: mlr
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
