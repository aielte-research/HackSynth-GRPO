Oops! The admin reused a nonce when encrypting two secret messages with AES-GCM. Now both ciphertexts are here: ciphertext1:cbcda0ba462a32777d66eb8668e5, ciphertext2: d9c9a8ae1d29382f207ef3de61b82f9806a7. Can you recover the secrets?

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{jyx3wlxh}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:cbcda0ba462a32777d66eb8668e5, ciphertext2: d9c9a8ae1d29382f207ef3de61b82f9806a7
tag1: 5a8a4312afcaeb4bb903a0a0dfb2ba9e
tag2: 1a17173ac7d77a28fa433ebe8fb060f9
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: d4af7aa058541c522a219ac3
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
