A secret was hastily encrypted using a flawed LFSR stream cipher. The intercepted message is: 6047674c7d4d644f705b6a443756

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[44894, 22447, 11223, 5611, 35573, 50554, 25277, 12638, 6319, 3159]

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{fbdvplo1}
ciphertext: 6047674c7d4d644f705b6a443756
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[44894, 22447, 11223, 5611, 35573, 50554, 25277, 12638, 6319, 3159]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
