Alice and Bob exchanged keys using Diffie-Hellman, unaware Eve was listening. Can you use their public messages to derive the shared secret and decrypt 80459b02e3a35400fc441f11311f?

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 50 and Bob's public key is 74.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
