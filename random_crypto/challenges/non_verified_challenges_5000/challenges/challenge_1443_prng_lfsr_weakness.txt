The archivist hid the secret flag using a flawed stream cipher based on an LFSR. Can you exploit this weakness to recover the message? Ciphertext: 1d5e1a55004b4b0115481342184f

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{y03nzhpc}
ciphertext: 1d5e1a55004b4b0115481342184f
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[51356, 25678, 12839, 39187, 52361, 26180, 45858, 55697, 60616, 63076]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
