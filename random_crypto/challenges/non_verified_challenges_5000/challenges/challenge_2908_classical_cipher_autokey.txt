A spy intercepted a secret password hidden with an Autokey cipher. Can you decipher it and unveil the key to the vault? Ciphertext: ez esku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{z9adv1qa}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{h9hqe1qn}
ciphertext: ez esku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{z9adv1qa}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: wmas
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
