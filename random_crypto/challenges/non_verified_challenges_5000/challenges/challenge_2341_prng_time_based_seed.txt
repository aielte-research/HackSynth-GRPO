A hacker hid the flag in 666cc3cb7b7a93c13971c8c2777d using a cipher seeded with the serverâ€™s Unix timestamp at encryption. Can you recover the secret?

The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 81869)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:03:13 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{z1m9qjnw}
ciphertext: 666cc3cb7b7a93c13971c8c2777d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 81869)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:03:13 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 41644.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
