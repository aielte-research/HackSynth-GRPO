An intern encrypted the flag with AES-ECB, using a 4-byte key padded with nulls. Recover the plaintext from 987278c0c15f75c09426589bb56a01ec.

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ycjgd0it}
ciphertext: 987278c0c15f75c09426589bb56a01ec
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
