Recover the secret: after forgetting the AES key, I padded my 5-char password with null bytes and used ECB. Hereâ€™s the encrypted flag: b6f035f56c2c9d8c28407126d9554bd9

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{xrjdfrj5}
ciphertext: b6f035f56c2c9d8c28407126d9554bd9
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
