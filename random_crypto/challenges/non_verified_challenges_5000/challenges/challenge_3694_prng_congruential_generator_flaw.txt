A mysterious hacker sent you an encrypted message, boasting their "unbreakable" LCG-based scheme. Prove them wrong by cracking the cipher: 6c0288b07119d1b13c00daa06513


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 1078890427
  - Multiplier: 346690300
  - Increment: 769708152
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [63197850, 368526973, 786011726, 965722421, 386479342] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{w8f6n3wo}
ciphertext: 6c0288b07119d1b13c00daa06513
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
