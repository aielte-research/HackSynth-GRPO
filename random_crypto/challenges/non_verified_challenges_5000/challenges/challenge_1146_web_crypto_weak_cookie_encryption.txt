The admin encrypted the flag with AES-ECB, using a short key padded with nulls. Can you recover it from a7276424ae9597ec149b56c1a8407425?


An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{fncgdxwe}
ciphertext: a7276424ae9597ec149b56c1a8407425
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
