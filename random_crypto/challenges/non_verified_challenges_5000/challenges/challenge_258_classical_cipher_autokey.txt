A mysterious hacker intercepted an old telegram. Its contents, encrypted with the Autokey cipher, could expose a secret plan if you can decode: te cyku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{1bxa8fm0}


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{1jen8om0}
ciphertext: te cyku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{1bxa8fm0}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: lryy
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
