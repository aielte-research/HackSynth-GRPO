A hacker intercepted a message encrypted with a time-seeded PRNG. Can you recover the flag from the mysterious 666c2c2f7b392c3f73673c276f7d?


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 33313)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:18:13 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{9awsgqoo}
ciphertext: 666c2c2f7b392c3f73673c276f7d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 33313)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:18:13 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 19784.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
