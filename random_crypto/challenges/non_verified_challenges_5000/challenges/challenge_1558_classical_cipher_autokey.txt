An agent intercepted a coded message believed to be protected by an outdated autokey cipher. Can you reveal the original text from this ciphertext? mk sipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{60c05av0}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{60j05ne0}
ciphertext: mk sipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{60c05av0}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: exo
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
