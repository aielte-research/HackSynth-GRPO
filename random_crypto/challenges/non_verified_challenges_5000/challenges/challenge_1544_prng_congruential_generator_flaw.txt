Hackers intercepted a message protected by an LCG-based cipher. Can you predict the next outputs and reveal the secret? Ciphertext: 667b88b87b2083ac68628bb9746a


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 164988290
  - Multiplier: 10965576
  - Increment: 12093747
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [79883529, 57148541, 74214153, 1396545, 49327447] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7jshubft}
ciphertext: 667b88b87b2083ac68628bb9746a
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
