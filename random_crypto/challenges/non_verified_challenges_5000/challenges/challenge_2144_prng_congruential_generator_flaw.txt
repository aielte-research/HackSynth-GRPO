An amateur hacker left their LCG-encrypted high scores online. Recover the original list using the predictable 63a0a69a7ea3a99836aaa8cb66b1 they posted.


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 839676029
  - Multiplier: 203191425
  - Increment: 632733413
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [640993643, 584756533, 402151054, 99382556, 106583838] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{one3fo6c}
ciphertext: 63a0a69a7ea3a99836aaa8cb66b1
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
