A secret key was exchanged over an insecure channel. Eve captured the encrypted message below. Can you recover the shared secret and decrypt it? Ciphertext: 65772b926208ab3df50023ad399c

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 90 and Bob's public key is 48.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))

flag: flag{vh7gokby}
ciphertext: 65772b926208ab3df50023ad399c
cipher: Diffie-Hellman
hint: The prime used in this key exchange is small. You can recover the private key by brute-force.
