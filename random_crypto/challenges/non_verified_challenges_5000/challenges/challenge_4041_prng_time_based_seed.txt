A message appeared on the blockchain, decryptable only if you know the exact second it was encrypted. Can you recover the secret from 666c31e67b3621b2696226b3337d?


The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 20707)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:43:11 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{6q3ibv23}
ciphertext: 666c31e67b3621b2696226b3337d
cipher: Time-based PRNG
hint: A predictable source of entropy was used to generate a secret number. Think about system time.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
secret_num = rng.randint(0, 20707)
The system time when the encryption process started was around: 2025-05-25 12:43:11 UTC. This number was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.
extra_info: secret_num = 20609.
subtype: time_based_seed
archetype: prng
