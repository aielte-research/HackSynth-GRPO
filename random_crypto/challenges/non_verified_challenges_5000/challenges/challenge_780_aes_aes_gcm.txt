An intern encrypted two secrets with AES-GCM but accidentally reused the nonce. Now both ciphertexts—ciphertext1:64e5dfc8fa9a7a257dcb8ee8b5e9, ciphertext2: 76e1d7dca184607372c699bce0b4c4fd2536—might reveal more than intended. Can you recover the secrets?

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{wivabct4}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:64e5dfc8fa9a7a257dcb8ee8b5e9, ciphertext2: 76e1d7dca184607372c699bce0b4c4fd2536

tag2: 4683e8f14947d74f1d981f14390893e0
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 8920ded84bdc753359298fa5
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
