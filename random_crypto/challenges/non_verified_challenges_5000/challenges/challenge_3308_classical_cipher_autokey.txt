An agent left a secret Autokey-encrypted message: lr zipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{9911opom}. Crack it to reveal where the next drop will be.


The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 3 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{9911vcxm}
ciphertext: lr zipu gaul, gje jirheamax tdutgbrdg papmnkw xezohi vaevbm.qxoy{9911opom}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
