An intercepted spy message was encrypted using a flawed LFSR scheme. Can you exploit its weakness to recover the original text from this ciphertext? 7dea7ae160b16de369b229e870fb

The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{7ver42nk}
ciphertext: 7dea7ae160b16de369b229e870fb
cipher: LFSR Weakness
hint: Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have predictable cycles. The initial state is given.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
A 16-bit LFSR was used with taps [0, 2, 3, 5]. The first 10 outputs are given below. The next LFSR output was used to XOR-encrypt the flag.
[6628, 3314, 34425, 49980, 57758, 28879, 47207, 56371, 28185, 14092]
extra_info: LFSRs are linear, meaning their entire sequence can be reconstructed given enough outputs.
subtype: lfsr_weakness
archetype: prng
