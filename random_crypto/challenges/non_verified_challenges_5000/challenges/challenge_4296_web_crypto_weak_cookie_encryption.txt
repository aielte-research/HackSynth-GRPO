A careless admin encrypted secrets using AES-ECB, padding short passwords with null bytes. Can you recover the original key using this ciphertext: a4299ee4c44a68c8c9054cfce10ce42b?

An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{eg0nyq1a}
ciphertext: a4299ee4c44a68c8c9054cfce10ce42b
cipher: AES-ECB
vulnerability: small key padded with null bytes
hint: ECB mode with a short key makes brute-forcing possible. Consider the small key entropy.
necessary_info: An encryption key that is only 2 bytes long?.
extra_info: Padding follows PKCS#7. The key is padded to 16 bytes with null bytes.
subtype: weak_cookie_encryption
archetype: web_crypto
