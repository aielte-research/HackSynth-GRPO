Agents Alice and Bob exchanged secret plans using Diffie-Hellman. Intercept their message: 7bc97aeaf4c1e45c2bce3983ac9e

The key exchange uses a prime modulus of 101 and generator 2.
Alice's public key is 10 and Bob's public key is 18.
You received a tip that the private values are at most two digits.
You got access to some of the code:
encryption_key = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_key).encode()).digest()[:16]
encrypted_flag = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(flag.encode(), encryption_key))
