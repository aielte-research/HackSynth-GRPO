EvilCorp obscured their vault password with their predictable LCG cipher. Can you reveal the secret from this ciphertext? 6c34adee7168f8f07861a1b93b25


The flag format is flag{...}
A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) was used with the following parameters:
  - Modulus: 347256342
  - Multiplier: 308249532
  - Increment: 25839877
The first 5 outputs of the LCG are provided: [771871, 314275135, 18449203, 137007013, 194961973] 
The next output was used as a symmetric key to XOR-encrypt the flag.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{04yr9m01}
ciphertext: 6c34adee7168f8f07861a1b93b25
cipher: LCG Predictability
hint: LCGs are deterministic. Find the seed or deduce the next output to recover the encryption key.
