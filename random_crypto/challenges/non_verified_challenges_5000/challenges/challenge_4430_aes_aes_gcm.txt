Two messages, encrypted by a careless intern, share the same AES-GCM nonce. The ciphertexts are below. Can you exploit this reuse and recover the secrets?
ciphertext1:abb7c3dcf24ce910277b54fbf6f5, ciphertext2: b9b3cbc8a94af65c3e6442b0f1a886c58d4d

The flag format is flag{...}

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{ollwpbkf}
ciphertext: ciphertext1:abb7c3dcf24ce910277b54fbf6f5, ciphertext2: b9b3cbc8a94af65c3e6442b0f1a886c58d4d
tag1: ab0175f50211c374f887cc85bb08b3fd
tag2: 401518f7739e69970f7468a5046f1a37
cipher: AES-GCM
vulnerability: nonce reuse
hint: AES-GCM with nonce reuse is vulnerable. Exploit the relationship between the ciphertexts to recover the flag.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
extra_info: The nonce used for both encryptions is: 985bbed3ba1c633305b1b4ce
subtype: aes_gcm
archetype: aes
