Intercepted from a hidden chat, this message is encrypted with an Autokey cipher. The secret keyword is rumored to be "ledger". Decrypt the following: bb hoku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{8g6abxr0}

The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.

## Challenge Technical Details
flag: flag{8o6hogr0}
ciphertext: bb hoku pesg, aug rwwtymprt gpscymmkz neaeiel eifbsi genugz.fwmu{8g6abxr0}
cipher: Autokey
hint: Autokey ciphers are vulnerable once enough plaintext is known, allowing reconstruction of the key.
necessary_info: The flag format is flag{...}
You got a tip from a friend that the encrypted message starts with: In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random.
The seed lenght is 4 and only alphabetic characters count.
extra_info: The key seed is: todo
subtype: autokey
archetype: classical_cipher
